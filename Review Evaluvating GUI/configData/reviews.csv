4764,"I have read this book twice now in the month that I have owned it. It's a deep, fiery, amazing love story that I know I will read again and again. You can relate to the characters and story line, i absolutely loved it. Especially since it doesn't follow the common stereotype of there having to be a feminine woman and a more masculine woman together to make it work. It's a beautiful novel and I am very happy I bought and have already gotten friends to buy and read it as well!",5.0

4766,"365 draftHer name belies her heart.  Left alone with a grieving mother and a houseful of girls, Patience Creighton feels her strength and perseverance slowly ebbing away as she watches her mother shrink into a shadow of her former self and tries to keep the school her father founded running smoothly without help from her absentee brother, Rawdon.  When a visitor arrives, bloody and beaten, on her doorstep late one evening, Patience&#8217;s fragile world begins to crumble.  The man is the rakish William Sterling, owner of the property on which the school sits and the subject of several scandalous rumors that Patience has heard whispers of.  Despite her vague wariness about him, Patience finds herself strangely intrigued and is disappointed when he disappears back into the night.  Their paths are destined to cross again, however, for William has enemies that will stop at nothing - even placing young girls in danger - to take their revenge.  Rosemere is all that stands between him and ultimate destitution - or possibly death.  But when he finds himself likewise drawn to the young headmistress, will he sacrifice her happiness for his own salvation?A beautifully written novel and the second in her well-crafted series, The Headmistress of Rosemere was a delight to read.  With depth of character and plot, a bit of mystery and romance and an excellent moral theme, the book is sure to cement author Sarah Ladd&#8217;s reputation as a writer of stellar historic fiction.  She adds just the right amount of darkness and intrigue to keep the reader anticipating the next page and spices it up with a lovely romance that blossoms slowly and comes to beautiful fruition in the end.  Five stars.I received a copy of the book from the author in return for the above unbiased review.",5.0

4768,"I began reading this while I was reading another European World War II &#34;thriller.&#34; I immediately abandoned that book and finished this book, as it was much better written and more engaging. The point of view of an architect/artist in occupied Paris was intriguing, and the flawed main character who overcame his cultural bias -- even hatred-- of Jews in order to use his spatial ability to create cunning hiding places for them presented a fictional conundrum that kept me reading. Of course, the insights provided into the occupied, the occupiers, the Resistance, and the collaborators made for page-turning fodder. I'm a sucker for WWII spy/thriller novels, and this was a very good one.",4.0

4773,"This book is not a traditional Amish story. It deals with the situation of a unwed mother in a very traditional Amish neighborhood. Carolyn Lapp had a child when she was a child. After having her child she joined the church and therefore received the forgiveness and acceptance of her community. However Carolyn who raises her son with the love and help of her parents always feels judged by others, including her brother.When her son Benjamin gets into trouble at an animal auction. He has to go to work for Joshua Glick who owns a horse farm in a neighboring community. Although this seems at first like a punishment it turns into an amazing experience, and helps Benjamin get out from his domineering cousins.Joshua assumes that Benjamin is Carolyn's nephew, although Carolyn never tells him this, she never corrects him either. Will Joshua still be interested when he find out - or will his domineering mother manage to control the situation.This is a really nice story. Also showing a son's appreciate and love to a Mother that sacrifices everything for him.This story is definitely worth a read. It even made me shed a tear or two.",5.0

4779,"Arthur Herman has written a highly entertaining work which is premised on the belief that the 2500 years of  European [and by extension American] history has been an epistemological struggle between the pure thought/mysticism of Plato and the practical thought/empiricism of Aristotle. While the hypothesis is stretched very thin at times, on the whole this is a fascinating exploration of  intellectual history.As do all historians, Herman brings to his work his own biases, prejudices and premises- it is impossible for any author to do otherwise regardless of how some may seek the the elusive goal of objectivity. It is the reason there could be and have been hundreds of thousands of books written about Napoleon- every writer has an opinion which structures his unifying narrative. Herman may therefore offend some when he opines that gridlock was Madison's intent in designing the government, or when he  includes Ayn Rand among the luminaries he discusses; his is definitely a more Classical Liberal view as opposed to say James Macgregor Burns' Progressivism in Fire and Light [which I have reviewed elsewhere] and this definitely contributed to my enjoyment of the book.But regardless of your political or philosophical predilections, I think anyone interested in Ideas will find plenty to learn and think about as Herman presents an all star roster of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time. As is to be expected, the sheer diversity encompassed ensures that not everything fits nicely into his basic hypothesis. I found the association of Hegel with Platonic ideas somewhat precarious, and when he discussed modern science I think he was somewhat out of his depth. And his substitution of NeoPlatonism for religion, while it did indeed substantially contribute to Christian theology, is somewhat simplistic if not entirely inaccurate, thereby rendering his final conclusion, that a combination of the ""head"" of Aristotle must be combined with the ""soul"" of Plato for the dynamic societal balance required for both progress and stability, if not invalid perhaps slightly off the mark. Just something to think about.And that is my point about the entire book. Sure it is simplifying in its presentation of too many ideas and philosophies to count- how could it be otherwise considering the sheer magnitude of the material covered?  And yes Herman definitely has a point of view regarding his topic- as already discussed, all historians do. And the underlying premise requires some softening and smoothing of the rough edges of facts- after all everyone likes a jigsaw puzzle that finally looks like the picture. But given all these criticisms, this book will still present you with  so many fascinating philosophers and their interesting and provocative ideas that you will have to take the time to think, and that is a pleasure we engage in all too infrequently these days. Agree with Herman or not, it will be very difficult to stay passive in reading this book- and that is why I  highly recommend it.",4.0

4785,"In today's world of throwaway relationships and serial marriages, it is fascinating to read about a couple who remained married and devoted to each other despite numerous infidelities, mother-in-law problems, crippling illness, and loss. Both Eleanor  and Franklin could arguably be used to prove the case that people do not naturally remain in love with just one person throughout our lives. Instead, we naturally evolve new loves and relationships as our personal needs change throughout the years. Some of us drop the old relationships as we move on to the next one, and others like the FDR and Eleanor collect people like they collect stamps. It amazes me that some people do not break off their relationship when they realize that they are just one of many ""loved ones."" What kept Louis, Daisy, Lucy, Nan, Hick, and Tommy loyal when they became aware of  being one of a collection?Read the book and ask yourself if you have ever met anyone who inspired your blind loyalty the way these two managed to do in their friends and lovers. Then sit back and enjoy a starting view of our country's history from within the Presidency.Five stars to Ms. Rowley for telling it exactly as it was!",5.0

4794,"I picked this up as a freebie the other day and took a chance on it. The negative reviewers concentrated on the grammar and editing but that has largely been sorted out. The story sounded intriguing; the h and her sister left England to avoid being forced to marry against their wills. They are part of English nobility but want to join their brother on his ranch in the US. On the ship over the 2 sisters dress as young men to avoid problems on the trip over since they don't have male chaperones (a bit of a weak premise). In this way the h meets the H, an American, who'd come over to escort his cousin to live with him on his ranch. There are sparks between the main characters from the beginning, even though he doesn't know she's a woman when they first meet. Both are firmly against marriage for their own reasons. The h is one of those feisty women who wants to be independent and beyond the control of any man. The H is a womaniser and doesn't want to settle for one woman. They have many encounters and they even become passionately involved but without commitment. Eventually the suitor that the h had back in England comes to claim her as he needs her dowry and he puts her and her family in danger.The interaction between the H and h really annoyed me. I didn't believe in their love and I found them both unlikeable most of the time. The things they said to each other were mean and some of the stuff the H said to the h was pretty unforgivable.",3.0

4800,"I'm not sure whether the technique here is properly called stream of consciousness or interior monologue. I suspect it's the latter. That point is important, for I read several of the other reviews here and think that people may have missed the point. Though the book is short, it is dense, despite the abundant white space on most pages, and the narrative technique, whichever it is (or both), may not be for everyone.The story is simple enough. It's the story of a less-than-perfect marriage. In fewer than 200 pages, the author takes us from day one of the marriage to . . . well, I won't say to where since that would give away the ending. But the story itself is only a part of the book, which is much more about the wife and her psychological difficulties than about the marriage itself.Some of the reviewers have called this novel &#34;literary,&#34; by which I presume they mean &#34;Literary with a capital L.&#34; That's a fair assessment, for there are deliberate stylistic techniques here that are as much a part of the story as the narrative itself. Indeed, the author even tells us flat out one of the techniques she uses: &#34;It's important to note the POV shift here.&#34; Several of the other readers, I think, missed the two shifts that dramatically affect the story.I bring this point up not to suggest that I am somehow more literate or learned than others--I'm sure that's true for some and false for others--but to instead hint at the fact that this book holds more than is at first obvious. I think &#34;Dept. of Speculation&#34; would be a fruitful source for serious, in-depth discussions. For those who aren't inclined to look more deeply, there are, I think, better books on the topic of marriage. But for those who enjoy the manner in which the story is constructed and told as much as the story itself, there is quite a bit here to mull over, including eclectic (dare I say post-modern) references to Einstein, Lynyrd Skynyrd, LOLcats, Rilke, Arabic proverbs, and more.",4.0

4803,"Ours have become a pop culture world where the most superficial of people are revered and the most serious of subjects are either trivialized or romanticized. &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; (currently the #1 YA read on the New York Times Bestsellers list) is being heralded as a great book, when the lesser known &#34; Fly a Little Higher: How God Answered One Mom's Small Prayer in a Big Way&#34; truly is a great book. Both deal with essentially the same subject: teenage cancer. John Green's novel is narrated by an inauthentic teenage voice. Sixteen-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster sounds more like a college English major than a teen. (She spouts T.S. Eliot, Fitzgerald and William Carlos Williams by heart). She dismisses faith, mockingly referring to the church meeting room as &#34;the heart of Jesus&#34; and consummates her relationship with a dying boy in a moment that (I'd guess) has some young readers swooning. &#34;Fly a Little Higher&#34; is non-fiction. Laura Sobiech is a mother who freely and honestly shares her fear, heartbreak and little joys with incredible grace. She celebrates her beautiful son's life while revealing the steeling and healing power of faith. Zach used his trials and his impending death to better his soul. (His love of music even gained him some celebrity. His song &#34;Clouds&#34; became the #1 song on iTunes the day of his funeral.) I am no prude, just a mom who knows a few things about heartache. &#34;Fly a Little Higher&#34; is thoughtful, empowering and uplifting. &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is so superficial it pales in comparison. So, if you have a teenager determined to read John Green's book, allow it as an appetizer. &#34;Fly a Little Higher&#34; should be the main course.",5.0

The story dragged at times (especially during the Minnesota history lessons), I found my mind wandering.I guess I was expecting more of an emotional journey from Evan.  Instead, I read about a summer filled with him making new friends, smoking weed, drinking and having sex.  His relationship with his father is almost non-existent, and while that does have some resolution, it wasn't enough for me.  The best parts of the book were his letters to Collette, he's reflective and somewhat remorseful.The ending (rather abruptly) fills in some blanks about his uncle Soren and &#34;the cupcake lady from Tacoma&#34; that are hinted at throughout the entire book, but their explanations felt like they were mostly an afterthought.

Each character seemed human enough and not just briefly mentioned to fill each paragraph. 5/5 for there being a beginning and an end to each chapter and not just the carrying on and use of endless filler to stretch out each paragraph. The author chooses her content very well and is not overly  concerned with a large word count, I feel the author was more about content of what made up the story, I feel that's a sign of a talented author. The zombies portrayed were a 5/5  as a mixture of slow and fast movers. The delivery of the virus had a refreshing feel to me and broke away from conventional norm im used too. The overall plight of the main character and her husband had me really caring for their well being so 5/5 for suspense and dramatic appeal. Next 5/5 for keeping me wanting a continuation of the story at the end of this book. There was just enough to give me closure of the story while knowing and hoping for more. All this being said im no writer, I consider myself  grammatically challenged. This author knows her way around suspense, zombies, strong women and small dogs so win win for me.",5.0
4835,"I read this because I remember the case so well and even wrote a self-righteous grade school essay on it when it was fresh.  While I am not a big fan of &#34;true crime&#34; books, this reminds me of Ken Cullen's &#34;Columbine,&#34; which I also read because it promised a revisionist account to an event we supposedly knew so well.  Cook's book does the same, but goes even further to explore how and why the myth of the &#34;38&#34; came to be and came to last.  I don't want to add a spoiler, but the last chapter, which provides a minute by minute account of what probably really did happen, is one of the most moving accounts of anything I have read in a long time.  It leaves the reader with a polar opposite view of how people can act during horrific circumstances.",5.0

4838,Blind Faith is book 3 in the Sin Brothers series and is the story of Nate and Audrey. Blind Faith is another awesome book but I must say the Senator and Protect story line was a little off for me. I really didn't see the point of the group and felt it was just a way to fill time. I would rather have had more from the groups who the Commander mentioned that he is in competition with. Overall definitely another good installment and the Dean family is growing.

4839,"State Attorney Daphne Montgomery's son Ford has been kidnapped. She thinks it's the work of the white supremacist family, as she has successfully put their son in jail. However, it would seem that Ford's kidnapping is only part of a larger plan, thought up by somebody who wants revenge on Daphne.A lot of the standard elements of a Karen Rose novel are here: the two main characters come with a bucket load of baggage that could fill up an entire TV series of its own. One of them is typically haunted by an incident in their past in which they were unable to prevent somebody from being killed. Lots of melodramatic dialogue. Rose is beginning to trot out the same back story over and over again.Usually, Rose's novels have contained complex plots that would help balance out the overly-gooey romantic moments (sorry, her romantic dialogue is just cringe-worthy). This is not the case here. Very early on in the proceedings - so these would not be considered spoilers - we are introduced to main villain Mitch Roberts, who wants to see Daphne suffer. He has kidnapped Ford and is setting up the white supremacist family to look like the guilty party. Right there, we have the idea of what has happened. It takes the various detectives, FBI agents, private eyes and other law enforcement folk over 300 pages to figure out what we, the reader, already know.I did not experience much suspense in waiting to find out something that I already knew. At least 200 pages should have been shaved off this 630-page book.There are also far too many characters running around here. Just about every single major character from Rose's previous books make some sort of appearance here, and it's beginning to get difficult to tell them all apart. It's also making all their hook-ups feel just a little bit incestuous. It is well beyond time to bring in a fresh set of characters to shake things up a bit. Preferably without the same old I-couldn't-save-her/him back story they all seem to come with.And I just didn't buy Mitch's revenge plan. It was ridiculously elaborate for what he wanted to get done, and his choice of who to bring in to his fold came with far too many possibilities for his plan to backfire (such as trusting a family of white supremacists all with murderous personalities - I mean, come on! Really?) The weak plot really emphasized the ludicrous nature of his revenge plan.The weak plot also brought to the fore Rose's florid dialogue and same-old, same-old contrived back stories that are usually easier to ignore if the plot is more complicated.I really didn't like this one at all. It was too long and too underplotted, considering her previous output. You're not missing much if you miss this one.",2.0

4850,"Lady in Peril - Men Blunder, Women Suffer by Calvin Bowden is a heart pumping thriller.  The book keeps you on the edge of your seat as it works it's way through a terrifying ordeal.The story begins with Helen ""Hellie"" and grandfather ""Papa"" and her daily struggle to overcome the trauma of the kidnapping and brutal rape by a man known as ""Animal"" Sadac the previous year. As she works through all of the fear, depression and guilt that she is experiencing, she finds out that the conviction of the man who nearly destroyed her life has been overturned and he is to be released on a technicality.  The inept sheriff Wart and his deputy not only forgot to read Sadac his miranda rights, but now she finds out that they have lost the evidence from the previous trial as well.We are immediately drawn into Hellie's fear and memories of that fateful event that so changed her life and when ""Animal"" Sadac escapes en route back for the second trial and blazes a murderous path back to finish what he did not get to do last time, kill Hellie.Victimized  even further by the local sheriff, Hellie has to learn her own inner strength as she and her friends and family fight for their very lives while Sadac begins murdering the people around her one by one trying to reach her.The tale resonates with how rape victims are treated to this day in the courts by the defense attorneys and the views of some of the towns people who believe the sheriff's claims that Hellie was not a victim but an eager participant in her own assault.The story stays focused with plenty of description without getting lost in pages of narration.

4854,"""Roland shivered with the effort of looking. He wanted to fix every detail in his mind for ever, so that no matter what else happened there would always be this."" It's been a number of years since I read Garner's books. I pulled them out and started into ELIDOR. Turns out - I didn't remember any details of this book in the series, so it truly was a new reading to me. Like so many of my favorite writers, Garner fits enough plot and character into 145 pages whereas many writers can't make a clean work in 500 pages. Written in the late '60's and my copy a reprint from the early '80's - it has a definite Narnia plot running - thin walls between our world and another that is being swallowed by darkness and needs the help of four siblings (David, Nicholas, Helen & Roland). A shift between the two worlds - a hunt for magical treasures is followed by a return to normal life at home and the slipping away of whether it ever happened at all. Similarities - but this story runs darker than Narnia. And the reminders of their adventure keep jabbing at these kids - bursts of static electricity, phantom silhouettes in the rose garden, some serious harassment of these folks front door and mail slot and even a handful plastic prizes: ""Are you saying Malebron's sending us souvenirs from Hong Kong?"") While the kids turn skeptic, Roland alone packs enough faith to keep the whole bunch on the right track and the story takes some clean, sharp turns - before clipping off abruptly. Geek notes: Had to go online and look-up a few things (dolmen - [...] and even found their old house address at 20 Fog Lane, Manchester: mappable). I'll be on into reading the next book in the series and see if it keeps me guessing, too.",4.0
4855,"D PLAN TO CLEAN-UP BOSTON HARBOR, (1989-2001), THE DEER ISLAND OUTFLOW PROJECT""They cared more about that Humvee than they did about the divers."" (p. 277)  quoting Dr. Maria Knafelc Investigator, USNNeil Swidey is an. indefatigable journalist who has written for the BOSTON GLOBE MAGAZINE for more than a decade. Two articles that he wrote for that magazine served as the launching pad for this incredibly complex, well-researched technical subject and ultimately legal drama. This is a difficult read, both mechanically and emotionally. When I was in college,I was told that the slowest readers were the engineering majors. TRAPPED UNDER THE SEA cut my ordinary perusal speed in half, meaning it took me twice as long to finish it as I would have a less complex tome of similar length (418 pp.).As Swidey's cumbersome title suggests: the book is about the tragic construction of the Deer Island Outflow Project, which was designed to clean up what was then considered the nation's ""most polluted harbor,""the very same water body that was the setting of the legendary Boston Tea Party; the bulk of the pollution of which was untreated human waste.The outflow system represented the final leg of a complex, expensive sewage treatment network on Deer Island just north of the metropolis that included a land-based congeries of a dozen egg-shaped anaerobic digesters,each ninety-feet in diameter and fourteen-stories high, in which the wastewater liquids would be separated from the solid sludge. In a separate location, the sludge would be manufactured into fertilizer pellets whereas the treated liquids would then be pumped into the deadend 9.5-mile tunnel dug 100-feet beneath the island's surface that would channel a daily dose of 140,000 pounds of sanitized liquid waste into the Atlantic Ocean through more than fifty vertical diffuser pipes far away from the harbor. The tragedy of this complex story resulted from the way that the huge project was organized, or need I say, ""disorganized?"" No fewer than seven engineering firms and government agencies were directly involved in the work at one time or another. Needless to say management was totally confused, particularly when it came to the issue of providing the five heroic tunnel workers with breathable air in the confined quarters of the nearly ten-mile tunnel. Swidey grew to intimately know each of the five men, their wives, girlfriends, friends, and parents  and tells the story extremely well. As a reader, you will feel the tension, almost as if you're inside the tunnel with the men. The climax came on July 21, 1999, when two of the five men died of asphyxia when air rich in nitrogen and starved of oxygen flowed into their face masks, killing them quickly, as they heroically tried to complete a task that would help to save their three other comrades who worked at the farthest, narrowest end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, few persons outside of the Boston area, including me, were aware of these worker's passing because of the nearly simultaneous demise of John F Kennedy, Jr and his wife in their small private plane off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, ironically, not that far from the site of the outflow-tunnel disaster. The last third of the book focuses on the lawsuits that sprang from the deaths of the two men and the aftershocks in the lives of the survivors. The book basically ends on a happy note: Because the $6 billion-dollar investment ultimately led to a dramatically cleaner Boston Harbor,the historic city no longer suffers from the stigma of ""the nation's most polluted harbor."" Indeed, it is even clean enough to accept large boxes of British tea. Moreover, because of the nature of this book, I foresee another Boston-based Hollywood extravaganza, starring naturally Mark Wahlberg, Ben Affleck,Matt Damon, and all of the other ""usual suspects.""Victor L MoteProfessor emeritus ofgeography, Russian studies, and political science atThe University of Houston Central Campus (1971-2011)aka V Traven, MEMOIRS OF A DROMOMANIAC (Bloomington, IN:Xlibris Corp.,2011), 277 pp.;SIBERIA WORLDS APART (Boulder, CO: Westview/Perseus,1998), 256 pp.;AN INDUSTRIAL ATLAS OF THE SOVIET SUCCESSOR STATES (Houston, TX: Industrial Information Resources, Inc.,1994), 300 pp.; andCoauthored with Theodore Shabad, GATEWAY TO SIBERIAN RESOURCES (New York: Wiley, 1977), 198 pp.",3.0

4865,"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is that book that truly succeeds in transporting you to a truly different place: a place where being wealthy means having a whole lot less, where values are different yet in some ways strangely familiar.The book follows the early adventures of Mma Precious Ramotswe, a thirty-five year old woman who opens the first female-run detective agency in Gabarone, the Capitol of Botswana, a nation with a population about the size of New Mexico, but a land area greater than that of California.The book does not contain a great centralized mystery that runs through it, though about a third of the way in, the disappearance of a boy who is kidnapped and presumably killed by a witch doctor keeps coming to the forefront through the rest of the book. Rather the book is collection of vignettes, some of about Mma Ramotswe's father and others about hear life and how she grew up to become a detective.There were sad things that happened in her life, but I disagree with reviewers who say she had a hard life. She seemed to have had a happy life with some sad moments in it and the book reflects her overall joy at being.Mma Ramotswe is a fascinating and very real character with her own ideas about the world. She's fiercely proud of her nation, and she's proud to be a Size 22 woman in a cultural that's traditionally valued women who are fat. She is usually very self-confident.She has to be, in selling her father's cattle and taking on the job of starting the first lady run detective agency in the country with nothing other than her reading of fiction and a detective manual. That takes guts. Her cases are filled with lots of high points and a few low points as she's still learning what she's doing. She does stumble occasionally such as in her following the daughter of a wealthy East Indian man, and the way she obtained evidence of one woman's husband's infidelity. Still, she also showed her keen mind when she found the secret of a doctor whose talents and knowledge seemed to vary from one day to the next, as well as the case of a man who disappeared during his own Baptism, and the case of the missing boy.More than just being a mystery book, what Alexander McCall Smith provides readers an experience. While the book is stereotypically viewed as of interest to middle aged women, it really is a great book for any human to read (and who knows, maybe some extraterrestrials too) as we experience rich character and rich settings which are unforgettable.I listened to the audiobook version and have to commend the narration of Lisette Lecat who does a fantastic job bringing this story to life and creating each character, regardless of gender.

I'm impressed!This book was so rewarding on so many levels.  Loved the dialogue, the romance between hero and heroine, the deeply motivated decisions and choices.  The hero (Tim) is a man I could (and did!) fall in love with; Lola is strong, capable, worthy of admiration from women (so easy to like!), and ultimately--very deserving of Tim's unswerving devotion.Buchman writes incredible action scenes, believable romance, powerful &#34;what-if&#34; military scenarios including the biggest, baddest disasters American soldiers could face.

4876,"About the Book:Book #1 in a trilogy from fantasy author Wayne Thomas Batson explores the concept of dreams and their effects on us.People are fascinated by dreams, and the Bible has a great deal to say about them. From Jacob's dream of the heavenly stairway in Genesis 28 to angels visiting Joseph during dreams in Matthew 1 to the Apostle John's &#34;waking dream&#34; from which he obtained the book of Revelation--dreams have been powerful ingredients of God's plan as revealed through Scripture.Fourteen-year-old Archer Keaton discovers he has the ability to enter and explore his dreams. He is a &#34;dreamtreader,&#34; one of three selected from each generation. Their mission: to protect the waking world from the Nightmare Lord, who wreaks chaos in the Dream World. But as Archer's dreams become more dangerous and threatening, so too does his waking life.Rigby Thames, the new kid from England, builds a suspicious rock star-like following at Dresden High School a little too quickly. Even Archer's best friend and confidant, Kara Windchil, seems taken in by the cool guy with the wild blond hair, which definitely rubs Archer the wrong way. Archer must face two foes in two worlds, but he cannot succeed alone. Archer sets off to find other dreamtreaders in a desperate attempt to defeat the enemy terrorizing his friends and family.About the Author:Wayne Thomas Batson is the author of several bestselling novels, including The Door Within trilogy, The Isle series, and The Berinfell series. As a middle school reading teacher, Wayne writes adventures set in imaginative locales because he believes that we all dream of doing something that matters.My Review:Fourteen years of age is really too young to be a hero, but Archer Keaton is a hero, nonetheless. Archer figures out how he can actually enter his dreams, he apparently had always had this ability but just didn't know it. He isn't the only one there are others like him, but not too many---just three from each generation. Archer must protect the world---the waking world from the Nightmare Lord which proves to be harder than one might assume. But soon it seems that his dreams are about to spill over into his daily life and that definitely proves to be very dangerous for him.Archer must find others with the same ability because he can't do this alone---right now its proving to be more than he can handle. So sets of on this journey he does, but his waking world seems to not be going so great either. Especially when a new guy shows up at school and messes everything all up. Because of this Archer decides he isn't too thrilled with Rigby from England and he wonders what all the fuss is about, anyway.**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from my participation in the CSFF Blog Tour.",5.0

4890,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Excellent sequel to this fascinating series. Even though it had its flaws this was still a wonderful read and I am very eager to read the next book.Opening Sentence: I was not conscious.The Review:Autumn Rose has just one year left as a guardian at a school where she is shunned because she is a Sage. The Sages are magical beings that live in the 1st dimension alongside the humans. They are extremely powerful and are looked to as leaders from all the other dimensions. Born with scars that run down the length of their entire body it is easy to distinguish who they are. There are also dark Sages known as the Extermino that want to destroy the human race. The rest of the Sage&#8217;s have taken it upon themselves to be guardians to the humans and protect them in any way they can.Autumn was raised in a very social London by her grandmother, but 18 months ago her grandmother passed away and now she is living in a tiny seaside town where she is one of the only Sage&#8217;s around. The circumstances surrounding her grandmother&#8217;s death were unclear and Autumn will stop at nothing to figure out what happened.On the first day of school a very handsome and famous young Sage moves into town. Prince Fallon was one of Autumn&#8217;s childhood friends, but she hasn&#8217;t seen him since her grandmother&#8217;s funeral. With his good looks and social status he immediately becomes the talk of the town, and Autumn is thrust into the limelight with him. She doesn&#8217;t know if she can trust Fallon, but there is something so comforting about him.Autumn is a very interesting girl that I really ended up liking. She has been through a lot in the last few years and it has caused her to fall into a deep depression. On the outside she puts up a great front so no one really knows, but deep down she is really hurting and has not properly grieved for her grandmother. It was easy to sympathize with Autumn and her situation. I also loved that even though she is royalty she acts and lives like a normal person does. That made it easier to relate to her. She was a fun character and I was glad to get to know her better.Fallon was not at all what I was expecting. He was introduced briefly in the first book, The Dark Heroine, and I thought he was going to be very similar to Kasper, but he was actually the total opposite. He is downright gorgeous, but he is actually very modest about it. He is more of a one girl type of guy and he was very sweet and respectful. I really loved him and thought that he treated Autumn so well. My one complaint about their relationship was that I felt that he had more genuine feelings then Autumn did, but as time went on I thought they ended up making a great couple.I wanted to start off by saying that this was very different from The Dark Heroine but in a good way. I felt that this one was written much better and the flow of the book wasn&#8217;t nearly as choppy. There were still a few times when I got a little lost, but nowhere close to how I felt while reading the first book. This book takes place at the same time as the first book, you are just getting Autumn&#8217;s story instead of Violets. The romance still had an insta-love feel to it, which I didn&#8217;t love, but I did like Fallon and Autumn together. They were cute. My favorite thing about this series is the amazing world that Gibbs has created; it is so fascinating and intriguing. That alone will keep me coming back to read the rest of the books in this series, which I think is going to be quite a few since it seems every heroine is going to get their own book. I am excited to see the rest of the dimensions and what they offer to the story. Also, I adored the cover to this book, it&#8217;s really simple but creepy and striking. To be honest, this book did have a lot of flaws, but there was just something about it that left me thinking about it days after reading it. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a unique YA/NA paranormal series, and if you didn&#8217;t love the first book, I would still give this one a try. I thought it was a much better read.Notable Scene:&#8220;Autumn, do something!&#8221; Nathan demanded, having caught up with me.The humans looked up for the first time and noticed me.&#8220;No, Nathan, he&#8217;s gone, I can&#8217;t&#8212;&#8220;Nathan shoved me forward, glaring. &#8220;You&#8217;re a Sage, of course you can. Sage can do anything.&#8221;I looked down at the man on the ground, shaking my head as tears brimmed. Why is he doing this? Nathan knows I can&#8217;t bring back the dead!&#8220;It&#8217;s your duty,&#8221; Nathan continued.The woman managed to stop sobbing long enough to speak. &#8220;They had grey scars&#8230;two of them. Hit him with black light.&#8221;Gray scars&#8212;Extermino! And black light&#8230;That was a death curse!FTC Advisory: William Morrow Paperbacks/HarperCollins provided me with a copy of Autumn Rose. No goody bags, sponsorships, &#8220;material connections,&#8221; or bribes were exchanged for my review.",4.0

You can watch Randi in action on Youtube.

4899,"Mavis Doriel Hay wrote only three mystery novels, during the period known as the Golden Age of Mystery. Her first, &#8220;Murder Underground,&#8221; was published in 1934, when writers like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers were already household names. It was followed by &#8220;Death on the Cherwell&#8221; (1935), set in Oxford, and &#8220;The Santa Klaus Murder&#8221; (1936), set at an English country estate. Hay continued to write, but after her third mystery, she turned to the subject of rural crafts, which she dearly loved.Hay was largely forgotten until last year, when the British Library began republishing a number of mystery novels printed during the Golden Age (like John Bude&#8217;s &#8220;The Cornish Coast Murder&#8221; and &#8220;The Lake District Murde&#8221;r). All three of Hay&#8217;s mystery novels are now available in both paperback and ebook versions.Murder Underground is set in north London, near Hampstead Heath, and it is a combination of improbable, bewildering and great fun.Miss Euphemia Pongleton (only a British writer would invent that name), a rather elderly resident of the respectable Frampton Private Hotel, sails forth one morning for a dentist appointment. She passes the closest tube station to save on fare, and arrives at the Belsize Park Station. Because of her fear of elevators, she decides to walk down the 220-step staircase. Along the way, someone strangles her with a dog leash &#8211; the leash for her own dog, taken from where it usually hung in the hotel entrance way.Miss Pongleton wasn&#8217;t a particularly nice character, and there are no end of suspects, including residents of the hotel and her relatives. And the suspects rather cheerfully go about suppressing evidence, changing evidence, omitting facts, and conveniently not remembering, to the extent that it becomes difficult to keep track of who was actually where, who did what, and who said what. The police inspector seems to be outsmarted and outmaneuvered at almost every turn. And several of the characters/suspects decide to do some sleuthing and investigating on their own, all for the very best of reasons (and one, of course, for the very worst).Is &#8220;Murder Underground&#8221;one of the great mystery stories?  No, but then no one is making that claim. It is representative of its period; there were numerous writers in both Britain and America during the Golden Age of mysteries, and most are largely forgotten.It includes diagrams of some of the scenes; I can&#8217;t explain why I&#8217;ve always loved diagrams in mystery stories, but I do. It does require a closer reading than one might expect with a mystery story, if nothing else than to keep track of how the characters try to screw things up.But it is a fun read.",4.0

4912,"This book's titular painter and first-person narrator, Jim Stegner, is a forty-something, twice-divorced artist who lives in a cabin in rural Colorado. He spends his days painting, fly-fishing, smoking, and thinking about alcohol (he&#8217;s a recovering alcoholic and hasn&#8217;t had a drink in three years). His daughter, Alce, whom he taught to fly-fish and considered his best friend, was murdered when she was fifteen, and he carries tremendous guilt over her death (he believes he didn&#8217;t adequately protect her) and grieves her loss every day.In part due to his grief over Alce&#8217;s death, Stegner has a lot of pent-up rage, and he has a tendency to unleash it in a very volatile manner when provoked . . . like the time he shot a man with a .41 magnum at point-blank range for making lewd comments about his daughter. Or the time an interviewer for a live radio show asked him &#8220;why, coming from a family of gypo loggers in Oregon, [he] had decided to paint.&#8221; (&#8220;It seems terribly brave. Or reckless? I mean where you came from. Your father was practically illiterate.&#8221;). The question pissed Stegner off (&#8220;[T]his question stopped my wildly beating heart for a moment and stiffened my bristles and raised hackles I suddenly discovered I had.&#8221;), so, in response, Stegner extended his hand, &#8220;like for a handshake,&#8221; and then gripped and squeezed the interviewer&#8217;s hand until &#8220;he was howling and then I felt a bone snap, one of the knuckles in the first joint and he screamed, an unbridled, uncensored live radio shriek.&#8221;Early in the book, this same rage leads Stegner to get in a fight on the street with a stranger. On his way to the creek to do some fly-fishing, Stegner witnesses the man beating a disobedient mare with a two-by-four, and he loses it. He climbs out of his truck, punches the guy in the nose, and takes the horse. This sets in motion a string of terrible actions and reactions, including arson, murder, and shootings. But, all the while, Stegner retains his peace of mind by fly-fishing and painting.Each chapter of the book begins with a brief description (similar to what you&#8217;d see accompanying a work in a gallery or museum) of one or two of his paintings, like:MayhemOIL ON LINEN40 x 50 INCHESCOLLECTION OF THE ARTISTThe chapter then, in an indirect way, describes the inspiration for the work, the circumstances surrounding it, Stegner&#8217;s mood while he painted it, and his process. This could easily come across as cheesy or gimmicky, but it doesn&#8217;t. Instead, it is a creative and stylistic device that allows you to understand Stegner a bit better and to see the motivation for his boiling anger and unbridled grief. It works.What doesn&#8217;t work as well for me is the writing style. Author Peter Heller has an MFA in both fiction and poetry. Fiction writers who hold MFAs in poetry have a tendency to write, well, poetically (Kevin Powers and his writing in The Yellow Birds is another example that springs to mind immediately). I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;m sure I will say it again: I am not a huge fan of flowery, overly descriptive, poetic writing. I find that overly poetic writing tends to weigh a book down, slow its pace, and make it feel contrived. This paragraph is a perfect example:&#34;Not a single car passed in not sure how much time. A katydid pulsed out of the grass on the shoulder. The blackbirds buzzed and shrieked in happy territorial arguments. The sun climbed over the low ridge behind me and threw my shadow down to water&#8217;s edge. After a while the beaver in the closest pond emerged and cut a faint wake across the still water. Came back. Some woodless errand. I could hear too the slow current pouring over the closest dam, shifting and burbling in the pool below. I painted. Painted the pace of it, the sounds as much as anything. The calm. It calmed me. That thing that happened where I disappear. Except this time it was not into the poised energy of a woman, or into some watery interior landscape, but into instead the quiet creek in front of me, into the raucous commerce of corvids, the inscrutable transit of a beaver, the slow breathing of the morning. It was different and soothing and freeing and I didn&#8217;t even know that I&#8217;d disappeared until I heard the higher vibration of an approaching car, still a ways off.&#34;I understand, of course, that this is a matter of personal preference. Some people can&#8217;t get enough adjectives and details about nature and pretty, lyrical sentences. If poetic writing is your speed, then you will love this book. But I found myself flipping pages to see when the next batch of dialogue was coming up. In refreshing contrast to that weighty, long-winded paragraph (and many others like it), Heller&#8217;s dialogue is straight and sharp. The combo of the flowery, descriptive paragraphs and the choppy dialogue offers a nice, conflicting juxtaposition that mirrors the contrast between the crazy, fast-paced action/crime side of the novel and the mellow, slow-paced, contemplative fly-fishing/having a smoke/painting side of the novel. I just wish the balance had been weighted more in favor of the straight and sharp dialogue and the fast-paced action.",3.0

4915,"Honor & Innocence was very well written. It had my emotions going up and down. I didn&#8217;t realize how terrible the situation was for the people of Germany after the war ended. My heart went out to them. The nice homes they once had were now a bunch of rubble.This story is about Hank and a young German friend named Max. It begins with Hank being drafted into the war. Just before he leaves, his father comes to him and tells him, &#8220;I should have been more open to share my life with you. It&#8217;s important that you know where you came from. We should be proud of our heritage.&#8221; Then he proceeds to tell his son that his grandfather came to America in 1905 from Germany, because he didn&#8217;t agree with the German government and what they were doing to the people. Many innocent people were killed in the name of the Reich. Now World War II was in full force and Hank might have to battle against his own kin who are forced to fight for Hitler.This story is told with deep feeling, as if the author had actually been there. I was surprised at the emotion I felt as I read the first chapter. Chapter two is when Hank arrives at the army base, so there tends to be some cuss words at this point. I would recommend this book to adults only because of the language. Other than that, I loved the story and it was hard to put down.--Review by Linda Weaver Clarke, Author of Historical Fictions",5.0

4917,"I won a copy of this book at a release party. I had never heard of Ashley Cassidy or Relentless Hope. I had no idea what to expect having not even read the synopsis. What I found was touching story of how a single person can make all the difference in a person's life, for good or bad. This story starts with a single mistake and ends with the hardest decision Aleah will probably ever make. In between we get see her grow from a frightened and alone young woman into someone ready to fight for what she wants.This story shows you glimpses into the struggles a young woman faces whose family is steep in the cultural traditions of Pakistan. Aleah goes from the extreme shelter and cocoon of her family to being vilified by them and forced to make decisions she never thought she would. She finds a unexpected friend at the lowest point in her life and is thrust into the drama of his billionaire status. I enjoyed watching Aleah grow and change throughout this book. Aleah finds she has feelings for her friends grandson Aiden, is afraid to let him into her heart. Aiden has been a spoiled rich brat most of his life and but finds Aleah a refreshing exception to most of the people he knows. There is a lot of chemistry between these two people. I am looking forward to the next book to find out if they can get past their differences and figure out just how to have a life together.",5.0

4922,"Calvinism was new to me as I grew up in strict arminian church where election and the thoughts of Luther, Calvin, Beza and Augustine were considered heresy. However, the way the new, young, and reformed Calvinists seem to present Calvinism could be viewed as harsh, condemning and almost sticking our fingers in our ears to despise a good dialogue. I spent 7 years sitting with men every week discussing reformed theology in a calm, biblical manner and could see the blossom of the TULIP flourish. The author wisely points out that attitude is critical in presenting the doctrines of grace and we, as strong calvinists need to learn more pastoral approaches and not just theological hammers.",5.0

4930,"I found Jude to be a compelling, thought-provoking read. The desire for political power by billionaire Jude Asher clashes with his twin brother Tom&#8217;s lack of interest in any aspirations that throw him into the public eye. A suspenseful atmosphere permeates the story through the mysterious forces that seem to further Jude&#8217;s efforts.Some scenes were a bit slow in moving the story forward, but for the most part, I felt drawn into the action, wondering when or if Jude&#8217;s efforts would be foiled.Characterization was well done. I especially enjoyed some of the psychological introspection revealed in Tom&#8217;s character as he expressed concern for his brother, yet harbored a reluctance to get involved with his political aspirations. His cavalier attitude toward his incredible wealth gives him a much more humanitarian minded world view than that of his twin brother.I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy books that deal with political figures and the wielding of power, as well as those who appreciate a well thought out story with a hint of spiritual warfare.Thank you to David C Cook for providing this ebook copy.",5.0

In many ways it is a disaster because of the political times, i.e., Vietnamization, and we we were fearful of losing too many lives and ammunition at the end of the Vietnam conflict.  Sufficient reinforcements were curtailed as well as needed artillery support.  On the other hand, it is a courageous story of American soldiers in action.",5.0

4939,"The cost of friendship can be hard in Walk A Straight Line by Michelle Lindo-Rice. Colleen MacGregor turns her life over to God after her marriage to Terence Hayworth is sealed. Colleen works to be the best helpmate she can be while struggle to keep her friendship together with her best friend, Gina. Colleen soon realizes that she has to draw the line at some point. Colleen has a lot of her plate because the man she fell in love with is not the man she married. Colleen&#8217;s world takes a dark turn and she has to come to some harsh decisions.Gina Price loves her best friend but the bible toting and holy than thou act is getting on her last nerve. Gina feels Colleen judges everything she does not that she has not done some questionable things, but her friend should always support her. Gina also does not care for Terence because she has a feeling there is more to him than meets the eye. Gina is dealing with her own issues and does not need a lashing from her friend. Gina is dating Michael but has desires for his brother Keith. The attraction for Keith is one that cannot be ignored but what is she to do especially when Michael has proposed. Gina finds herself in a sticky situation, which will she choose?Terence Hayworth has been preparing for the ministry and now has a wonderful wife to complete his look. Terence&#8217;s mother gives him advice as any mother would until he marries Colleen. Terence&#8217;s mother will do whatever she can to get rid of the new Mrs. Hayworth. Terence has a momma&#8217;s boy mentality that just may cost him everything especially when his wife puts her foot down at the situation. Will Terence learn his lesson? Or will he let his mother ruin his marriage?What I Did Not Like: Terrence&#8217;s mother drove me crazy with frustration.What I Did Like: It was about friendship, family and marriage. It expressed how hard it can be to have friends that are not saved. This book had well-developed characters, drama and suspense. The author does a wonderful job showing Colleen and Terence&#8217;s marriage evolving as the book progressed. I also love the fact that both Colleen and Terence had issues that caused them to stand up for themselves. I definitely recommend Walk A Straight Line to others.This book was provided by the author for review purposes.Teresa BeasleyA&RBC; Reviews5 Stars=Non Stop Page Turner",5.0

4943,"Having read Herman Koch's first novel to be translated into English, The Dinner, and now Summer House with Swimming Pool, I feel that I can comfortably say that Koch is a master of the truly unlikeable protagonist. I wasn't sure I could dislike another character more than The Dinner's Paul Lohman, but Dr. Marc Schlosser has Lohman beat, hands down. One might be forgiven for assuming Schlosser just has a dry sense of humor, when he tells us on the very first page about his examination of a patient's liver:If I press any harder, it will burst open right there in my office. Can't have that. It makes an incredible mess. Blood gushes out in a huge wave. No general practitioner is keen to have someone die in his office.We soon figure out, however, that he is just a complete and utter jerk. Here he is, talking to a friend's wife with whom he is contemplating an affair:As a matter of fact, I didn't give a [expletive deleted] about the whole subject. But I could never let her notice that, of course. I had to go on playing the interested, sympathetic man. To go on feigning sincere interest. Only the sympathetic man would get that to which he had a right.Anyone who thinks he has a &#34;right&#34; to another man's wife deserves to be taken down a peg or ten, so the reader cannot be faulted for being unsympathetic to the very real possibility that Schlosser will lose his medical license for causing a patient's death.In her New York Times review of The Dinner, Claire Messud observed that &#34;North American readers care inordinately that fictional characters be likeable,&#34; and my review thus far might suggest that, because I disliked Schlosser, I also disliked Summer House with Swimming Pool. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I found it riveting to be trapped in the mind of this self-centered [harsher term for jerk deleted per Amazon guidelines] as he struggled with the quandary all parents of daughters fear: what do you do when your child is raped and the culprit seems to be at your mercy? I'm pretty sure I know what I would do, but Schlosser's decision and its consequences ensure that I'll at least think twice.I received a free copy of Summer House with Swimming Pool through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",4.0

As you read, you get involved in the mothers, fathers, children and grandchildren. You want to see how their lives turn for better or worse, the same things that happen in real life. As I read, I discovered that, although I watched the series on TV, the books are so much better. The books really go into more detail and more things happen. I realize that all this cannot be conveyed to the small screen but, it makes reading the books worth the time. Since the TV series was shown on the Hallmark channel, known for less sex and violence, the sex was mostly eliminated from the TV series. The books have a little sex but not in great detail so it doesn't take away from the story. I have read other Macomber books and enjoyed them all. This series is no exception.",4.0

4960,"This author has found a place in my heart. The stories she writes are the type that stay with you for a long time, they are stories you want to read again. I would love to see this particular story made into a Hallmark movie.The story opens with a young couple, Eby and George, on their honeymoon who are just taking their time and traveling wherever whim takes them. Along the way they purchase antiques and trinkets to furnish their home. Eventually they will return home and want to set up their home with these items so they will be surrounded by the memory of this time. Instead of ending up in the home they bought they decide to buy a piece of property in Suley, Georgia that has a house and vacation cabins on a lake called Lost Lake.The story continues in the present and you are introduced to Kate and Devin. Kate's husband and Devin's father was killed in an accident. Their house has been sold and they will be moving in with Cricket who is the domineering mother-in-law. On that particular day Kate heads up into the attic to track down her eight year old daughter, Devin, as it is time to leave. Kate finds Devon playing around in her favorite trunk, A trunk that is filled with old clothes that she just loves to dress up in and pretend. Devon finds an old postcard from Eby and asks her mother who Eby is. It is at that time that she discovers her mother had kept it from her to keep her away from her Great Aunt Eby. Kate's mother had taken her to Lost Lake one summer when Uncle George passed away. Her mother and Great Aunt Eby had an argument and they left suddenly.Kate and Devin decide at the last minute not to move into Chricket's house but to head to Georgia and visit Great Aunt Eby and stay with her at &#34;Lost Lake&#34;.From there you read a wonderful story full of delightful and funny characters that are so well created that you become part of their lives and story.This is a heart warming story of love lost, love found, family, friends, and children who are given the freedom to be a &#34;free spirit&#34; and enjoy their childhood to its fullest.I can't wait for the next &#34;Sarah Addison Allen&#34; novel to hit the bookshelves.",5.0

4965,I keep thinking Ms. Scattoline cannot pen a better book than her previous effort but I was wrong. Keep Quiet is one of those books that starts slowly. I hung in there and by page 96 the action and the tension and plot twists were like a whirl wind. I ended up reading through most of the night to see how it would turn out.Jake's teenage son Ryan is driving at night and accidentally hits someone. Jake should not have allowed him behind the wheel as he had a learners permit but he was trying to establish a closer bond with his son and made a mistake. A big one.Ryan is 16 and a sweet kid and when he knows he hit someone the guilt consumes him and he is hysterical.Jake rushes out of the car and tries to get the woman to breath to no avail. She is dead. After some quick soul searching the father decides to leave the scene of the crime to save his son who he loves more than his life. That deep abiding love and misguided decisions are what fuel his actions throughout the story.There is one character I hated from page one until the ending. Jakes wife. She is written as a bossy conniving woman and there is nothing she does in my opinion to redeem herself.The action keeps ratcheting up with every chapter until I was on the edge of my seat! The ended blew me out of the water.I highly recommend Keep Quiet. Its a keeper....pardon the pun.,5.0

4969,"Well, here I am stuck in a quandary.  The Bear Project, the second book in the Projects series, tells the tale of Emmi Layne and Cole Jackson who meet after Emmi&#8217;s tour bus takes off without her.  As a bear shifter, Cole immediately recognizes his mate, and wastes no time in her seduction.  From a purely erotic perspective, this book is a hot, sizzling, smoking five.  Hands down.However, I had a few issues with the storyline.  For example, time moves oddly- there is one scene where Emmi is talking to a friend, and then two sentences later, she is consoling said friend who was crying after having some sort of altercation in the yard.  What? When was there time for that to happen?  I was also unsure of some of the &#8220;rules&#8221; around shifters- it seemed at some points that humans knew about shifters, and then didn&#8217;t in others.  Either way, Emmi handled the news that Cole was a shifter without even a blink.So, for the rating?  As I said, the erotic/sex portion of the story is super-hot, a definite five.  I had some issues from the story itself, and would give it a 3/5 rating.  So, do I average them?  I&#8217;m not sure, but based on the fact that I am intrigued by the series, and want to read the first one (The Orgasm Project &#8230;sounds like fun!) and can&#8217;t wait to read Maria&#8217;s story (hopefully it will be out soon) I decided a 4/5 was in order.  After all, how many books do a good job of making you interested in reading the other characters stories as well?I&#8217;d recommend this novel to those of us who love hot alpha shifter male loving.

4977,"See full review @ The Indigo Quill: theindigoquill [dot] blogspot [dot] comI received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Wow, this is probably one of the most useful self-help books I have ever picked up in my life. There are a million-and-one great resources you can use to put a dent in your in-law relationships. God knows I've experienced both sides of the spectrum! Deb Armond exhibits class and grace in achieving healthy God-focused interaction between mothers and daughters-in law alike. She answers questions like &#34;Does it have to be bad? Can we all just get along?&#34; or &#34;What does it mean to leave and cleave?&#34; All important issues that are avoided, dreaded, or often misunderstood.The format of Related by Chance, Family by Choice is very easily translated and organized almost as a workbook. After each chapter, DeArmond provides the reader(s) a &#34;Self-assessment&#34; and &#34;Plan of Action&#34; to create a more positive approach for progress in MIL/DIL interaction. In my opinion, these approaches seem very practical and just might work. We tackle the cause and effect of experience, belief, action and world as well as tips for the DIL to &#34;make the break&#34; and the MIL to, dare I say it, &#34;Help them go.&#34;&#34;What's the outcome of disrespectful behavior toward your MIL?&#34; is another hot topic to be discussed in this book. Critical, but effective approaches to acknowledging the issues that can appear and how to handle them. I think one of my favorites was &#34;Learn what your MIL's love language is.&#34; Granted, it can prove to be advantageous to learn anyones language as a means of communication, but it makes perfect sense in this vital part of one's circle of life. The book isn't just for the DIL, but DeArmond also talks directly to the MIL's and their expectations. Without giving everything away, we are provided well organized alternatives to getting defensive and creating a much more positive environment where the most important player, God, wins.I think this book can be incredibly useful. I plan on keeping it on my bookshelf for future reference and lending it out to my friends and family. Actually, I already have about 3 people in line to borrow it from me! 5 stars for Miss DeArmond.",5.0

4979,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Tease is a heartbreaking novel that explores friendship, regret, and forgiveness through a teenager&#8217;s point of view. This book is perfect for any fans of The Perks of Being a Wallflower!Opening Sentence: &#8220;Did you ever have a physical confrontation with Miss Putnam?&#8221;The Review:Sara doesn&#8217;t really regret what happened that year- when a depressed teenager took an extension cord and hung herself because of harsh words from her classmates. Sara and her friends have been accused with criminal charges, but in Sara&#8217;s eyes it wasn&#8217;t her fault. After all, Brielle, her best friend, made up all the scenes that allegedly led to Emma&#8217;s suicide: Sara simply followed them through. Emma was selfish to leave such a mess for everyone over just a few jokes, and she deserved all the rumors, after stealing Sara&#8217;s boyfriend. But as this novel continues, Sara must learn to accept and appreciate Emma&#8217;s struggle and to forgive herself and others.The chapters switch between the times before and during the incident and after, when Sara is dealing with the lawyers and the stares. I really enjoyed this. It gave me a chance to not only understand what had happened, but why and how. Sara&#8217;s feelings were vividly described in a way that all teenagers could understand. Honestly, her whole point of view was comfortable and I could relate to the way she talked and thought. Plus, I got to see how she changed in mentality as the story progressed.I not only loved the main characters, but also the secondary ones as well. They all had distinct personalities. Brielle was very sharp and rude, Carmichael was insightful, and Dylan was kind and slightly naive. Ah, Carmichael. I absolutely adored his character, so strange and outcast, and yet so lovable and understanding. He was Sara&#8217;s love interest and I only wish I had got more time to spend with him.I still don&#8217;t know whether I liked Emma or not. After all, Sara&#8217;s early perspective had given her a somewhat less appealing version of Emma than the one you grow to know. The first Emma, the boyfriend stealer, sort of spoiled the kind, insecure Emma that killed herself. Because of that, I have mixed feelings about this character, though by the end I was leaning towards liking her.Definitely check out this book if you liked The Perks of Being a Wallflower (and honestly, who didn&#8217;t?). You won&#8217;t regret it. It is also about a troubled teenager, and there are also other similarities that you can&#8217;t overlook &#8212; try it out! I don&#8217;t know about you but I really love the cover, even though it isn&#8217;t that fancy. It&#8217;s so simple and yet conveys a lot of meaning: it has the &#8220;we didn&#8217;t mean to hurt anyone&#8221; that is bolded, the red girlish &#8220;Tease&#8221;, and other details. And the content is just as amazing as I believe the cover to be! This is truly a masterpiece that requires your immediate attention&#8230; buy it as soon as it is released!Notable Scene:But Emma&#8217;s the one who got the last word. She&#8217;ll always be that face, that pretty school photo in the newspaper. And we&#8217;ll always be the monsters who pushed her over the edge.I can talk to Teresa or Natalie or my mom &#8211; well, I can try- but no one really gets it, no one hears me. No one understands how, when Emma went over the edge, she pulled all of us down with her.FTC Advisory: Balzar + Bray/Harper Collins provided me with a copy of Tease.

4980,"Note- This review is based on the 1982 original hardcover edition of this book.  There a 1997 paperback second edition that corrects some errors that are in this 1982 edition.  The paperback is also shorter, because some of the material that is in the earlier edition has been deleted. Unfortunately Amazon has lumped the reviews of both editions together, in spite of the fact that there are differences between the two. Also note that my 3-star review is of the book not of the work done at Bletchley Park, which is five-star.I have read and reviewed numerous books covering the Bletchley Park efforts to break the German Enigma and Lorenz machines, but this is not the one that I would recommend because:- A full one third of the book discuses Welchman's work after he left BP and this material is very dated and I found it to be of little interest.  It covers his work on military communications and should have been the subject of a separate book.- Welchman comes across as implying that he was the most important member of the staff at BP, whereas his most important contributions came relatively early in the war, before he became what we would term a manager instead of an individual contributor.- Much of the book is quite technical, but I found the technical explanations to be inferior to what is covered in other books or in Internet articles on Bletchely Park, The Enigma Machine and the Bombe Machine.  These other sources are much clearer, in spite of the fact that Welchman is writing about his own work.  It is just that he takes too much for granted in terms of the average reader's background and like many experts does not do as good a job of explaining things as someone who is just a better teacher.I would recommend Budainsky's ""Battle of Wits"", Sebag-Montefiore's ""Battle for the Code"", Kahn's ""Seizing the Enigma"" and Singh's ""The Code Book"" as better sources on the details concerting the efforts to break the Enigma machine ciphers.  If you are interested in firsthand accounts of the work at Bletchley Park, I would recommend ""Codebreakers, The Inside Story of Bletchley Park"", edited by Hinsley, and Stripp, which contains over 30 essays written by worker at BP.I did not dislike this book.  I give it a neutral 3-stars, because I did find some interesting material in the book; it is just that there are much better books on the subject.",3.0

4984,"I received a copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads, so here is my review. There is so much pain and anger in this story, it will make your heart hurt. Josie has been through hell, but her life seems to be getting better with her best friend Seth. She transfers to college from junior college and is roommates with Brooke and they become very close. While Seth and Brooke are there for her, she meets Blake and begins to have feelings she never thought she would feel for any man. While her and Blake get closer, Seth hates it. Seth is the only one at school that knows her secret and he wants to protect her from any more pain. There is so much going on and you think you know where the author is going with the story but let tell you, don't even try to guess, you will get it wrong. I thought I had it figured out and I did on one part but the others threw me for a loop. And the ending will tear you apart. The story does go from past to present throughout but you can follow because it will fill in any questions you might have. There is so much loss that Josie goes through and you wonder what else is going to happen to her. I am about to start That's a Lie (book 2) and see where Victoria Klahr will take this story. This is a great debut story and I loved it.**Wicked reads Review Team**",5.0

The curse says that when the two Curse Keepers meet and touch, the gate holding in the evil banished spirits with the open. Ellie meets Collin who is the other Curse Keeper while she is working.

It adds to the sensual storyline and adds a touch of dark emotion where needed. But I'm biased because I love me some hot sex scenes.This book is extremely well written.

4997,"If you are reading this review you probably have a general idea of what The Black Dagger Brotherhood series is all about. This is our twelfth rodeo with Mrs. Ward's bad ass, hip-hop loving, sexy as hell vampires and I still look forward to these books every year. Now that almost all of the charcters that we have met over the series are mated, I felt like The King was a reboot of sorts to the series, meaning we went back to the beginning. Beth and Wrath are the center of the plot and how their relationship is working out is what we are looking at throughout the book.That relationship has hit a brick wall, i.e. baby talk. Wrath of course wants nothing to do with it and Beth is in the baby corner. I thought the conflict it brought to them was impact full and you could understand what both sides were thinking throughout so ultimately this was actually a fluid story to tell, especially since  they have been married for a few years now and all the trouble they've had to deal with outside of their relationship. It was nice to a have a refresher on two characters that I loved so much I read 11 other books following their tryst with romance. Plus, the ending......I won't spoil it but I'm just so happy for both of them!Now, outside of our main stars it got a little wishy washy for me. I liked seeing the plot about the Bastards and glymera council grow and the social aspects of vampirism shake out and grow. The Shadows Trez and iAm really intrigue me enough to hope they get a book too, including learning about their own race and how that works along the line of Rhevenge's book. However, the story line with Assail and Sola just bores me. No other way to put it, I really have no idea why we even told that story or where we are going so I have no use for it. I also have a problem with the Layla/Xcor situation but I am willing to give that one another shot and see where we are going....I have faith in that story line. Overall I thought it was another great installment that left me wanting more but I do have a feeling we are getting a little stagnant and I hope we can still keep this series going with thunder!",5.0

5000,"Review by Ameena Z.Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a beautiful blue stone in the nearby mountains he so frequents and hunts in. Before he can find a suitable trade for the rock, the stone hatches a majestic sapphire-blue dragon, Saphira. From that moment on Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider and is ushered into taking on a role; a role that will lead him to either partner with King Galbatorix, the tyrant who rules all of Alagaseia or the Varden, comprised of human, dwarves and elves. Eragon and Saphira are the last hope for the Varden but can Eragon overcome the power that Galbatorix yields? Paolini paints a vivid tale of friendship, adventure, love, and magic.This is the first installment in the Inheritance Cycle Series by Christopher Paolini. What makes this tale even more magical is the fact that Paolini wrote it at a ripe age of 15. He took pen to paper and let his imagination soar. After three years of polishing and editing it was published, thanks to his parents. His parents realized the potential when they came across his final manuscript and had their own small publishing company put it out. Through Paolini touring and readings, Alfred A. Knopf picked up his book and republished it in 2003. Since then he has completed the Inheritance series and it is truly a compelling work.  He is now 30 years old and working on other novels.",5.0

It was kind of cute, but I can't say I liked Jordan or Jaynee at all. Jaynee was very, very weak, and seemed incapable of making ANY decisions for herself. Ok, she has a bad history. She could have been made to be at least a little stronger!And then Jordan. Super organized, and wealthy beyond imagination at 27 years old, a self-made man. He makes every single decision, and she just goes along without protest. I think she protested twice, for about 5 seconds, in the entire book. I also found the ending very predictable.

5005,"&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; FIVE STARSA heartbreakingly beautiful story from Melissa CollinsI wasn't sure what to expect reading Let Love Live, being my first m/m book and all, but I adore the rest of Melissa Collin's The Love series, so how could I not read this one? I'm so glad I did! I was sucked in from the very beginning- stayed up all night reading it- and felt lost the rest of the day from a huge book hangover.This book can be broken down in two parts: before and after, past and present.Having read the other books in the series, I knew what was going to happen in the first part of Dylan's story. But even still I wasn't prepared for the gut-wrenching account of Dylan's first love and the injustice of it all. Part one broke me. I'm not a big crier when it comes to books. It takes a lot to get me there. But this book? BIG ugly cry. I actually messaged Melissa in the middle of the night, needing to vent to someone who understood. She wrote it so beautifully, so full of emotion and pain. I truly felt like I was living the story. I wanted to jump through the pages and beat up the bullies, stop what was going to happen, hold Dylan and make the pain go away. I wasn't sure I could go on after part one, but I pushed through and I'm glad I did.Part two finds Dylan seven years older, but still struggling to move on after the tragedy he went through with his first love. He feels guilty and is unable to commit to a serious relationship. He's basically just going through the motions and not truly living. Enter Conner Michelson.Conner is an ex MMA fighter who has just opened up his own gym. He's had a hard past and he's finally at a place in his life where he's ready to settle down. When Dylan comes into the gym one day, he is instantly attracted to Conner and vice versa. But of course Dylan isn't looking for a serious relationship and tries to fight the pull he feels toward Conner. But Conner doesn't give up easily and pushes Dylan to see what he's missing out on- what they could be if he would just let him in.Where part one completely broke me, part 2 perfectly put me back together again. Let Love Live is a hauntingly beautiful story of friendship, love, loss, grief, and learning to live again. A story that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend Let Love Live and the other books in Melissa Collins' The Love series.""...my heart needed a hell of a lot more than warming. It needed a heat wave and that's exactly what it got when Conner made me a part of his life.""~Dylan",5.0

5025,"Divided picks up a few weeks after Dualed - West is ready to put her striker days behind her and is now a weapons instructor along with Baer, happy to start a new life with Chord. The ghosts of her past still haunt her, though and she suffers from the guilt and horror of what she had done to survive. Her becoming a striker wasn't strictly necessary but it made her feel better about the fact that she would be ready for any situation. And now her being a striker comes to bite her when the Board hires her secretly to carry out one last contract which would have a high payoff. Tempted by the reward, she agrees to it, but when she returns to that life, she realizes the part she was trying to get rid off would always be a part of her, and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Yes, she was an assassin but she survived too.The major arc of the story is, of course, West's psyche. She has to go from being a completed to a striker to an active. The Board was never to be trusted and by working for them, she just dug herself into a hole. Finally, she asks the help of her loved ones, a major development for her, since she always gets things done by herself. The relationship between her and Chord is also tender and sweet and while it may feel like it wasn't really on the forefront, it is a major part of the story. The way he is supportive of her, even when she makes decisions he doesn't approve of is a testament of their bond. The love is so subtle and developed so naturally - even in the first book, I couldn't pinpoint the exact moment they become a couple; it was like the chemistry was there all along.I found the ending quite good but it left a lot of open ends. The secret of that lab research, what the choice Chord gives her would mean for them, the non-Alts - it all makes it seem that there might be another book. And since this has been confirmed to be the last book, it makes me all the more disappointed that there won't be any more in this series. It's just the writing - it draws you in with the description, the so well drawn-out scenes, particularly those of the hunt - the author really has a knack for building up the suspense. The rendering of the scenes is almost movie-like and quite realistic to be honest. It makes up for the slow pace in many places. About the world-building, I wasn't satisfied in this book, really, since I expected a bit more of the Surround and all. I mean, are those people out there just letting this city of killers be? So many questions and not enough answers.Received an ARC from Random House via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review",4.0

The starting point maybe  the same but the path taken by each author is so different.DEFENDER  I was hooked by the end of page 1.  Cyrus, Vara, Alaric, and all of the others are well developed . I close my eyes and can picture them with my mind's eye.  The conflicts among the members of Sanctuary are so real and the outcome painful to all even the reader.When the troupe goes on a quest you go with them.  Fast paced well written.  I got hooked.

Sultans and knights, griffins and magic  2 slaves, a young queen and a young boy are on a mission to save the realm from an evil mage who will stop at nothing to claim all for his own.

I have Book 1 to Dawn of Dragons waiting to be read.SWORD OF ARACHON 1st of 3 in the Shader TrilogyI admit i was not impressed with the beginning of the book  You meet a sensitive 7 year who has seen his dog killed by a bully.  He carries the body home to bury it.  He meets his tutor .  Chapter 2 now Shader is 37 years old a warrior priest fighting for the right to wield the Sword of Arachon.  The subsequent chapters more than made up for the rather boring beginning of the book.  The cast of characters grew - an order of knights, a liche that appears to be obese, a interfering tutor, a guild of assasins- and the action none stop.  No the balance of the trilogy is not on my to read list because I have already finished it. Great reads all 3THE WEIGHT OF BLOOD (Half-Orcs)An twist on how far one brother will go to help another.  Harrauq  and Quarrah are half orc and half elf.They are not accepted by either  race.  Harrauq, the eldest does the bidding of his younger and sickly younger brother Quarrah.  What is done in thename of brotherly uuldinglove is horrendous.  Quarrah aligns himself with an evil mage and brings Harrauq for the ride.  A battle ensues and an unlikely ally-an elf-comes to their aid and helps them escape.  The more I read, the more i wanted to know.  Yes , this too has been added to my TO READ LIST(That list is so long now)RAVENWOOD  Okay who would think that a book about a 50-something wandering old lady would be interesting.  Turns out Tanyth Fairport is anything but boring.  A small woman traversing the kingdom trying to gather all the ancient lore from the last of the wise women.  Her goal is to write a book of herbs and healing.  She is on the last leg of her journey heading north to Gertie Pinecrest.  She spends the winter with a group of young men and women building.a town from scratch  It is in this tranquil gathering of souls that Tanyth begins having visions and feels her powerful attachment to the gods of the earth.

'Delicate Rain' charts the ill-fated exploits of a young teenage girl who runs away from her comfortable yet cloying home to take up with a bunch of drug-pushers. The Delicate Rain of the title is both the nickname for our heroine and the moniker given to the new synthetic wonder-drug that Rain's new friends are pushing. Finding herself enmeshed in a gang war Rain soon finds herself out of her depth, expressing her gradually shifting views on her new criminal life in a series of poignant journal entries to her parents.Rain is a sympathetic and well rounded character, and the narrative is both fluent and engaging.

5038,"This is an Amazon freebie that I thought sounded intriguing. The execution is a bit strange though. The setting in Germany was nice and different and I enjoyed the change. The h is a struggling musician and artist, down on her luck and battling to survive. She's left her family because of an abusive step-father and is alone. When she's unable to pay part of her rent, her flatmate tells her to prostitute herself. The first time she tries, the H picks her up and takes her to his apartment. He isn't interested in having sex with her but he wants to help her. The H is very secretive but he insists the h stay with him until she gets back on her feet. Their relationship develops with time and they learn each others secrets. The premise is great and the development good but the melodrama just got to me.+++Minor spoilers+++Various elements were way too predictable and the h's going back into the heart of her family to 'save' them was not realistic. I truly hated the part where the H's ex arrived back. It was predictable and too much at that exact point in the story. For me it didn't work.I suspect that this is an inspirational book but it's not totally clear. Some references to God and a few religious remarks. The book is clean.",3.0

5041,"I was a little disappointed in this book. It is aimed at 10- to 13-year-olds and tries to be a sort of Young Sherlock. I'm all for this sort of thing and in many ways the elements I would expect to enjoy are all there: a decent story involving a Sinister Secret Organisation, thoroughly idiosyncratic lead characters, plenty of deduction and action, idiotic grown-ups being made to look foolish, young people sorting out the incompetence of adults and saving the day&#8230;and so on. It ought to have been thoroughly enjoyable, but didn't quite manage it.The main problem is that it all feels a bit stuff and stilted so that I didn't quite engage with the central characters, nor get really caught up in the plot. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why, but none of it felt quite real enough to work as a detective caper which left the sillier aspects of the story just looking&#8230;well&#8230;silly rather than enjoyably crazy, and the humorous elements are all a little forced. It's to do with the writing, I think; although it's competent enough, the style is slightly laboured. I don't know what it is that makes some writing really flow (if I did I would be a much better writer myself). My feeling is that this gets close but doesn't quite manage it, and I had a sense of wading through it rather than being carried along and it all felt a bit by-numbers.I'm sorry to be vague, but it's my honest view. I see some reviewers share my reservations while others have enjoyed the book a lot, so it's obviously a personal thing. You may well get on better with this than I did, but I'm afraid I won't be bothering with any more in the series.",3.0

Most of the heros are damaged in this type of story, which is ok but, is predictable. Not so with Ford! Yes, he has a bad history but, he never lost sight of the fact that he wanted a relationship with Adra. And the way he went about it! He was relentless! My favorite phrase throughout the book, 'this man'. Yeah this man, geez!

5059,"On LOTR itself: This is about the 5th time I've read LOTR, and there isn't much that I can add to what others have said before me. The first time I read it, I got very bogged down in The Two Towers battle scenes, and that's still the hardest part of the book for me to slog through. And I wish that Tolkien had gone back and forth between Frodo's journey and the rest of the Fellowship rather than an entire &#34;book&#34; following one and then the other. It's a different kid of read than the &#34;the pages turn themselves&#34; kind of book, meant to be mulled over and read slowly rather than pushing straight through. On the upside, when you reach the end, you feel well-satisfied, unlike those books which leave you wishing for more. (And when you do want more, there are all the other books and stories around the Tolkien universe.)On the kindle edition: Compared to other kindle editions of large volumes/sets of books, this one is much better done. It doesn't crash or lag terribly, it is easy to navigate between the endnotes and the text, and the table of contents is well-linked & brings you to your spot quickly. Downsides are a) it's hard to get to the maps (I finally bookmarked them ... not ideal, but better than losing your spot every time), b) I like to switch back and forth between the Fellowship's journey and Frodo's journey (books 5 & 6, aka Return of the King). That isn't really possible in the kindle edition without a lot of trouble, c) the chapter titles are positioned just right so that occasionally I hit the title instead of advancing a page & end up thrown back into the ToC. A minor annoyance but a pain when it happens. I wouldn't trade the hard copies I have, but it's nice to have the kindle version when I'm travelling.",5.0

5065,This was seriously the most perfect conclusion to the Trust Me Trilogy! It was just how I pictured it would be. I'm kind of a sucker for sweet stories like this but it wasn't all that sweet thanks to Alistair. There were plenty of times when I wanted to punch that old man in the throat. Aiden at times was so passive. I felt like he just let the insults slide one too many times. But after all that is his father and they love each other no matter what. At times I wanted to shake Jenny and make her realize that Alistair didn't have power over her. Once she got into her story with Jason I understood it all. She was out through way too much. It's a lot to handle for one person.Callie and mike made me super happy by the way! Overall this was a great conclusion to this trilogy. It's romantic yet frustrating at times.

I wish I could give it 5 Stars, but I just cannot.This is a very good book,  Like other reviewers have said, it ties up a lot of loose ends, and gives a good conclusion to the series.  I for one was glad to see that not every protagonist managed to survive the chaos of the war.  But on the other hand I question the final battle scenario.  The whole thing seemed a little rushed and not really well thought out.  For an Alien Civilization that always thought collectively to suddenly split like that just did not make a lot of sense to me.  Also for Admiral Smith the ram the alien flagship without giving his crew the chance to abandon ship seems counter to his basic instincts.If you have read the first two books in the series you need to read this one to finish the series.

5078,"Mary Ann(e) Schwalbe sets a fine example of how to handle the process of inevitable death in a period that is too short, although in her case she beat the averages for pancreatic cancer. She fought to the end without apparent self-pity or disengagement from her amazingly broad network of friends, associates and loved ones. Of course, even a nicely written memoir by a loving son and skilled writer would not be enough to propel this book to its fame. The clever idea of tying Mom's decline and support by her son to a long series of books makes this special.Most of the book references are quite brief, almost in passing, with perhaps two dozen getting more discussion. Even there, the length is modest, providing insight into what the books meant to them and enough flavor to help the reader decide which ones might be worth a personal look. Excluding the small number I have read, about ten might make the cut to join the queue. A significant shift into more of a book review mode could easily have bogged down the parallel threads on Mary Anne and the books themselves.Mary Anne obviously was a talented and dedicated person who made something of substance with her life. I'll cut the author some slack on the Ivy references and other name-dropping. She was someone to be proud of. About the worst he can say is that Mom wasn't the creative type and that she would make herself feel guilty for accepting a blood donation and other things where no apology was appropriate. Maybe she had more of an edge that he kept quiet.I miss my own mother and the books we used to share. Nothing at this level, but an important memory to preserve.",4.0

I liked the book but I didn't love it and that is what's bothering me because the story had basically everything that I love. I should have been gone over Shayla and Reid (especially Reid)but I just couldn't connect with them. They were both good characters and had interesting back stories and the whole story line about Robert missing and them having to find him, loved it and I was pulled into the story right from the start.

5082,"An absolutely delightful book that deserves a big audience, for lots of reasons. The heroine is smart, interesting, sarcastic and totally relatable in that she manages to get in the way of her own happiness. She's also laugh out loud funny (I embarrassed myself in public more than a few times.) As is her family - some of the Sunday-with-the-folks scenes are just hysterical. The plot is well-covered in lots of reviews here so I'll just reiterate that it is indeed fresh and romantic, a fun ride from beginning to end in the same way that Ephron's movies are.What also made it a stand out for me: it's not just the main characters that shine, they all do, with story lines are all satisfying and, in some cases, wonderfully surprising; the dialogue is truly terrific, Yellin has a rare gift for it; it's more than funny, it's also meaningful and poignant.

I didn't know that this was a part of a series when I ordered it, but it didn't finish like a series, which I liked.

5101,"Ok.  I cannot  hold it any longer!  I am only at 56% of my ebook, but do not need to read any further to know a winner when I see, or in this case, read one.  First off I would like to ask Takerra to never take time off as long as she did between the writing of Restricted and Restricted Too.  Evidently, she was not resting , but rather honing and sharpening her lethal writing skills to such a degree that she came out swinging with her deadly pen game to annihilate  any contenders!  Total annihilation of any other authors that seek to dethrone her as the number 1 heir to the throne of quality writing.  I was trapped in the weaving of her tale and struggled to be released; but this writer had her foot on my neck and her hands wrapped around my mind from the very first page.  My heart was pumping, my brain shut down all comprehension trying to figure out where she was leading and why was I so willing to blindly follow..  There is no predictability to be found.  When you think you have the dilemma solved, Takerra turns you around in another direction.  My emotions are all over the place.  I thought I had found my true romantic hero to love forever, only to have me doubt the veracity of my choice.  The hero and heroine are taking me into caverns that I do not want to enter with them; but find that Takerra has robbed me of my free will with her tenacious hold of my flailing emotions.In the twilight of my menopausal years, I have never experienced a hot flash, but since reading this book, my physical and mental faculties have been under attack with a heat, that at times became unbearable.  If you want to read a book that has mystery - this is the book for you.  If you wish to read a book with an unpredictable plot - this is the book for you.  If you wish to read a book with erotic bedroom/elevator/kitchen scenes - this is the book for you.  Do you want to read a book about confused love - this is the book for you.  If you did not make it to your house of worship this week, not to worry; Takerra took you to church right in the privacy of your home with scriptures that can ironically be meant especially for you!  She has definitely covered all of your emotional bases within the context of the book she saw fit to title Restricted Too.Do not miss out on the best read of 2014 and may find that it will extend even beyond.  Takerra has put everyone on notice; her crown will not be taken easily.  If you wish to enter the arena, bring your best and most skillful writing skills into the ring.  This young woman means business and is not in this path just to dance, but to skillfully dismantle what you may feel is the best that you have got!  I am anxiously awaiting other sequels to be written this year, but those writers have a very hard act to follow.  The bar has been risen to such a height that it will be pretty difficult to emulate the one who has made it safely to the other side; her name is Takerra Allen.  Remember her name because you will be singing her praises for years to come, and buy this book ASAP!!  You will be extremely glad you did!Now I shall get back to reading the other 44% of this stupendous book!  Cannot wait for the finale!  No matter, if it's to my liking or not - I still shall remain a life long fan !",5.0

I'm already a fan and I can't wait for more. Sawyer & Jake couldn't be more different. Jake is confident in who he is. Knows what he wants and has always wanted and finally takes who was always meant to be his. Sawyer is beautifully broken. Yes he's a rock god who has it all, but does he? far from it. He's just existing and putting on the face of what his fans want to see. When his longest friend re-enters his life, the broken pieces of Sawyer's past begin to be put back together. He discovers his true self. As a reader, you get drawn in to the emotion, physical connection between Sawyer and Jake. I know my heart hurt at a few parts, but so worth it.",5.0

5107,"Sex. It&#8217;s a constant topic today, isn&#8217;t it? Whether you read entirely within Christian media, entirely outside of it, or a bit of both, you can hardly avoid the topic. And if it&#8217;s not sex itself, it&#8217;s one of the related topics&#8212;homosexuality or abortion or marriage. There are few areas where we find such debate and few areas that have greater impact on life, family and church.Denny Burk has just stepped into the fray with What Is The Meaning of Sex?, a wide-ranging treatment of what the Bible says about sex and sexuality. This is not a guide to a better marriage and certainly not a bedroom how-to. Instead, it is a book that addresses sex in the big picture&#8212;the biggest possible picture&#8212;by discovering the ultimate purpose for sex and, from there, its many implications.As the book begins, Burk explains his belief that much of our discussion about sex has been derailed by confusing the ultimate purpose of sex with its subordinate purposes. These subordinate purposes&#8212;the consummation of marriage, procreation, love, and pleasure&#8212;are good and God-honoring, but insufficient on their own to understand why God created sex. The ultimate purpose of sex, he says, is to glorify God. He proves this with a careful exposition of 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 where Paul corrects a sexual aberration among the Christians of Corinth by commanding the people there to use their bodies for God&#8217;s glory. &#8220;The ultimate purpose of sex is the glory of God. Sex, gender, marriage, manhood, womanhood&#8212;all of it&#8212;exist ultimately for the glory of God. The glory of God as the ultimate purpose of sex is not merely a theological deduction. It is the explicit teaching of Scripture.&#8221;With that foundation firmly in place, Burk spends a chapter rebutting those contemporary theologians who like to pit Jesus against Paul as if Jesus the loving allowed all manner of sexual practices that Paul the prude later banned. Still sticking very close to the text of the Bible, Burk shows that we understand the Bible best when we see Paul&#8217;s words and Jesus&#8217; words as friends rather than enemies. The rest of the book then builds upon this ultimate purpose and this careful hermeneutic by looking at some areas related to sexuality that are the subject of debate today.Chapter 3, &#8220;Glorify God with Your Marriage,&#8221; carefully traces what the Bible says about the definition of marriage: that it is covenantal, sexual, procreative, heterosexual, monogamous and nonincestuous. Burk proves its purposes from its definition, saying &#8220;Marriage is a sexual union for the purposes of consummation, procreation, the expression of love, and pleasure.&#8221; This &#8220;covenant sexual union of one man and one woman tends toward the glory of God as it symbolizes God&#8217;s redemptive love for his people through Christ. In this way sexual union within marriage tends toward the glory of God.&#8221;Chapter 4 is titled &#8220;Glorify God with Your Conjugal Union&#8221; and here Burk turns to 1 Corinthians 7 to show that sexual intimacy is both a privilege and a duty within marriage. He interacts with recent trends within evangelicalism that allow and even endorse certain sexual acts and aids (focusing critical attention on Mark and Grace Driscoll and their book Real Marriage). He suggests and, I think, proves, that such people have succumbed to a serious misunderstanding of Christian freedom. He also provides a careful, excellent overview of what the Bible teaches about divorce and remarriage.As the book continues, he looks to family planning, pondering if and how married couples can glorify God through the use of birth control; he looks to gender, interacting with those who teach that gender is not a binary state but more of a scale in which a person may be more female than male but neither one fully; he looks at the most pressing issues in the debate on homosexuality; the final chapter turns to singleness and addresses topics such as delayed marriage, pornography and masturbation.In the conclusion Burk explains three ways people expression confusion about sexuality today, answering each from Scripture and within the lens of God&#8217;s ultimate purpose in human sexuality.While there is a great deal to commend in What Is The Meaning of Sex?, let me point to just three of its most notable strengths: This book is biblical. No matter his topic, Burk never strays from a biblical text and as he looks at those texts he consistently applies careful, nuanced exegesis. This book is timely. While the principles are timeless, the issues he interacts with are most relevant and extremely helpful in our time and our context. This book is pastoral. While Burk is a scholar, he is also a pastor, and he brings together the best of both worlds by proceeding carefully and logically, but always with a view to real people in real situations.What Is the Meaning of Sex? is a good book&#8212;a very good book&#8212;and one I heartily recommend. There are hundreds of books out there on sex and marriage, but none quite like this and I believe it will prove especially helpful to pastors and to ministry leaders who find themselves navigating increasingly tricky waters. Burk&#8217;s careful work in the text of Scripture lays a foundation that will provide guidance for even the most perplexing question.",5.0

5114,"*****5 Stars*****I just jumped into this book right after finishing Changing Course, which I loved. I would say I love this one even more. Yes, you can read this as a standalone but I highly recommend you read Changing Course first. The story takes place between the end of Changing Courses and the epilogue, and then after the epilogue as well.I love, love, love Emma. Not only did I feel like she was a strong character, she wasn't annoying to me. When she was emotional I felt like I would be too and she had every right to be. This made me feel more connected to her.Now, This book has a totally different feel than from the first book. The characters are so different and even though both stories revolve around one tragic accident 5 years ago. I love that these books show how everything can change in an instant and how it effects everyone differently.Caleb is still hung up on his fiance Manda's death and still blames Sarah for stealing his life from him. He wants revenge and is willing to do anything to get it. When Emma, Sarah's sister comes to town and meets Caleb for the first time it may change things for him. Emma decides to move from Savannah to Chicago to care for Sarah while she is in treatment and to be closer to her. She asks Caleb to update her on Sarah's progress while she gets everything together for her big move. He wishes Emma was anyone but Sarah's sister. He wants nothing to do with Sarah but he finds himself unable to say no to Emma and they begin a long distance relationship over the phone until she moves.Knowing that they are walking into something that could be terrible. They still want to try and give it a shot. Just as she arrives to Chicago she finds out how much Caleb truly hates Sarah and things get ugly and this is just the beginning of their long list of problems. There are a lot of thing that come between them and the truth of the night that changed everything unravels and only they can decide if love can rule over hate.I really don't want to give much away.  But you should definitely read this book NOW! I LOVED IT!",5.0

5125,"Every page of George Gilder&#8217;s book, Knowledge and Power: The Information Theory of Capitalism and How it is Revolutionizing our World, sings in celebration of capitalism. The particular lens that Gilder applies involves the intensity of impact from the information revolution on society. Gilder uses a conversational style of writing to express thoughtful and clear views on support for entrepreneurship and unfettered capitalism as key to building and maintaining a world in which all members of society achieve gains. I&#8217;ve read Gilder for decades and found much in this book to be so familiar as to seem repetitive. To avoid that becoming boring, Gilder has peppered the text with recent and current examples of the themes he explores. Every capitalist who reads this book will find something to like. Socialists will find the prose of a worthy adversary that requires a cogent response.Rating: Four-star (I like it)",4.0

5127,"An Asgardian fantasy for young people, Odd and the Frost Giants is a fun short read that is perfect for a bedtime read to little ones.  I was able to keep the attention of my five year old through the adventures of this little adventurer that Gaiman constructed as a young man hammered into unusual circumstances and joined by a small unusual hunting group of companions.ODD follows the standard Archetypal Hero&#8217;s journey, and is full of archetypes throughout to guide him on his quest.  As someone who reads a tremendous amount, there was nothing to this book that was surprising to me, but the method to which Gaiman presented this tale is always the most engaging and fulfilling part of his work.  It was whimsical and beautiful, and the straightforward and engaging text was easy to digest for my little boy&#8217;s short attention span.I feel like I am a little bit over the Norse tale, but the new way of telling the story was enough to keep my mind occupied, so I didn&#8217;t mind it as much.

5128,"I started this book for 3 times, not being able to move on with it in first two attempts, but in the end, I am really happy I read it. It was really hard for me in the beginning to read about all this self misery and hiding in a closet things. It is just not for me and into me, but after some time, I developed sympathy both to Ezra and Aysa.Sparrows for free is a really well written novel. Lila is a master of the words and feelings and she is really very good at describing them and translating them to her readers. The love story, the struggle are really great. They are so common and yet so rear that you can find something that reminds you about your own heart ache, touches your soul and make you smile or make you sad along with the main characters.To say the truth, I was slightly disappointed with how it all ends. The Aysa that was described in the beginning of the book have nothing to do with the Aysa that is in the middle of the book and is a completely different person to the one in the end. I can't say that it is because of her personal growth.. for me it was more to the incomplete work on her character, but I might be wrong, because I can't say I really understand her at all.Mostly I like the idea of telling the story from different POV, so you know what's happening to both Aysa and Ezra and sometimes this kind of storytelling was a real page turning for me, because I was dying to know, what the hell is happening to Ezra in this situation or afterwords )I can't say that I agree with the ending Lila choose for them. I would even say I totally disagree with her and the decision Aesa made&#8230; will see what's happens in the second book )",4.0

5138,I received a Kitchen Aid food processor and it came without a recipe book.  I checked this book out of my local library and was so impressed that I had to purchase it.  It was so incredibly helpful. Ms. Gilletz gives step by step instructions for working the new food processors.  She starts out with very helpful tips and each section has more tips.  She has a section on baby food.  She has information on why one should use organic food and she has lots of suggestions for healthy eating.  She suggests uses for the food processor that I never would have thought of.  She tells how to use it for baking.  It is far less time consuming to mix cookies and brownies in the food processor than in my stand mixer. Ms. Gilletz has a section for Passover cooking and information on Kosher recipes.  All of her recipes are simple and easy to understand.  I have saved a lot of time in my kitchen and I have streamlined my use of the food processor saving lots of clean-up.  This book is a must have.,5.0
5139,"I'm not the kind of person who can divine the allegory behind an author's story or printed sentence, but this book seemed to be a look into the lives of a small group of people and their motivations and how the life of one person can affect the lives of many in ways you wouldn't expect and regardless of the relationship between the people. Depending on the kind of life you've led and the people you've known, you may or may not find the characters to be &#34;real&#34; in that they seem to have more than their fair share of faults, idiosyncrasies, and secrets, but I found them to be very real on many levels. If you don't find them to be real or believable, just remember it's a novel, not a psychology text book.Nothing about this book is remotely related to the Harry Potter series, so you should approach this book as if it were written by someone you never heard of. Also, I found that this is NOT the kind of book you &#34;can't put down&#34;; nevertheless, I felt myself drawn to seek its conclusion.

Except now somebody is hunting the hunters, and Geralt of Rivia has to find and neutralize powerful, deadly, unscrupulous enemies. The game gets much of its power from the fiction of Sapkowski, whose works are relatively unknown in English. It got me interested enough to read this and the other available titles recently translated into English. This is the one to get! It's something like a series of short stories, although there's an over-arching plot line that involves a mysterious lady... to say more would be a spoiler.

Also, does Australia have a target and a Kmart?To be honest, for most of the book I thought they could be in the U.S, however the spelling and language told me Australia or England..

The author never passed an opportunity to describe her as super intelligent.  However, she never did much in the book that would affirm the author's description.  In fact, other than reading books about economy,  she acted kind of dopey and clueless most of the time.  Another reviewer observed that the author wasted way too much of the book developing peripheral characters.  There would be pages of build-up and details, then the character's small part in the action, then the character would never appear and rarely be mentioned again.  I found this to be a pattern as well and quite annoying at times.  I had some other issues with the book that I can't describe without being a spoiler.

5157,"""Hypothernia"" is the sixth of Arnaldur Indriason's series of 'Reykjavik Murder Mysteries' to be translated into English. The original Icelandic novel, ""Harskafi"" (whose meaning is unclear, but which might be rendered as 'Slim Pickings')"", was published in 2007 as the eight book in the series. (For various reasons, the first two volumes have never been -- and are unlikely ever to be -- made available in translation.) This 2010 English rendition is by Victoria Cribb, and provides a characteristically idiomatic translation of the author's original sparse, almost minimalist Icelandic prose.This volume in the series has Inspector Erlendur well and truly off piste, as he whittles away relentlessly at a number of seemingly unrelated mysteries, none of which give any indication of having a crime behind them, with not only the reader but his own colleagues at Police Headquarters wondering just what he is up to throughout much of the book.  With Sigurdur &Oacute;li and El&iacute;nborg barely making an appearance in this book, this is very much a story about Erlendur more than anything or anyone else -- it is a story centred on obsession as well as depression and melancholia. As the book progresses, Erlendur increasingly seems to be cutting himself off from events of the present and dwelling increasingly in happenings of the past, while the story generally lingers far more around matters spiritual and supernatural that one normally expects in this series.Unusually for books in this series, this volume features a glimpse of Iceland beyond the streets of Reykjavik and takes in a number of locations on the tourist map; as a consequence, those readers who have visited Iceland may more easily relate to the settings of this book than to some others in the series. Also unusually, the more Erlendur digs, the more of his mystery pieces start dropping into place together, making this by far the most interconnected and intriguing of Arnaldur's stories so far. In keeping with the book's all-pervading feel of gloom, however, the ending -- whilst well-delivered and fitting -- has of it something of gently understated tragedy. It also hints that in at least one regard, not all of the outcomes have yet been revealed and something weighty may be being saved for a future volume.For all of its doom and gloom, this book is gripping and engaging throughout. It makes for a cracking read, once you are used to Arnaldur's sometimes idiosyncratic prose style, with his plot construction maturing very nicely indeed here.  Although the book has few dependencies on preceding volumes in series, it is very hard to recommend this volume in isolation, as it makes much more sense taken as part of the series in which it sits.",5.0

5162,"Many, many times over the past several decades I have wished for an easily held library.  I have used the HCSB for a couple of those decades, primarily as a resource in my Bible Study software, and appreciated its worth.  Being able to download it for my Kindle was a very pleasant surprise- like having an old friend move to town.It gives me an opportunity to have a Bible with me all of the time- even while packing a few novels and do-it-yourself books [on my Kindle].  I recently decided to carry it with me for church and Bible study- and find it very usable in those situations, quick to look up passages, easy to enlarge the type if needed to read at a distance, and a real treat to have a &#34;slightly different angle&#34; on a given passage.I would highly recommend it to anyone with a Kindle and a desire to have a usable Bible with them.

The old saying &#8216;don&#8217;t know what you have until you lose it&#8217; fits in well with a story of two friends who both want more, but in the end keep resorting back into the &#8216;friend zone&#8217;.Jacey is sweet, but I think she feels as if karma keeps her from following her heart. Every time she follows it something bad happens making her step back instead of forward.Jax is great. He&#8217;s the ever loyal friend, the one who is always there for whatever Jacey needs or wants&#8230;even if he wants more. He&#8217;s that sweet type of boy we all want our daughters to end up with.This book starts out hilariously. I laughed so much during the goose incident. But then&#8230;it flashes back to an event in their past&#8230;and then another flashback to a different event. Yes, those events may explain why Jacey acts the way she does, but for a four chapter book and two are flashbacks&#8230;ugh! This is however the prequel and in saying that I hope the next book focuses more on them in the &#8216;now&#8217; and less on them in the past because they are interesting characters and I&#8217;d like to see what happens to them.My Favorite Moment: A jellybean game with new rules of engagement.

5176,"This book is written in a question and answer format. It is not very in depth but the author list  the references  , the web sites. contact numbers, one would need to follow through with the advise she gives. She does a good job of mentioning all the areas to consider when looking to retirement finances, this is a book to read when you start to seriously approach your retirement age. By reading this book I understand better what is the best time to draw social security, and which age will give the most benefits.There are some sections that would really benefit some one under fifty in the sense of showing them the areas to start investing and the things to consider so that at your retirement age finances won't be a concern. What is very in lighting is the concept of the 4% rule and how its works, for that you will have to read the book.So the bottom line is this book is a good one to have on the reference book shelf.

5179,"Right into the second chapter, I was extremely confused. Once I got to chapter four, I was slightly upset and even more confused than before. This last book, this supposed culmination of a trilogy, was basically a different book altogether. I honestly felt like Divergent and Insurgent were the true beginning and end to a story, and Allegiant was fan fiction the author couldn't help but throw in.We get a completely different plot that ends up overshadowing the main plot of the first two books, our Mary Sue character apparently becomes a bit too perfect for the author to handle, and a character who is clearly emotionally unstable and extremely codependent on the main character suddenly becomes the main character himself.I adore Toby. He is like that hurt puppy you want to cuddle all day long. But we just spent two books cheering on the extremely perfect Tris. I don't mean perfect as in she can do no wrong, but I do mean that in the end she always fights for the greater good and we are all fans of the greater good. And now you're giving us the boy who spends all three books still in fear of his father, and honestly never getting over the abuse he felt growing up. He latches on to this inherently strong individual who offers him love and support in a way that no one else could. He is honestly weak, as shown throughout the the book and at the end. He doesn't give us any true character development. I'm supposed to just be okay with this because he is obviously the authors favorite character considering she gives him a voice here and some side stories? Or is she just bowing to the masses of little girl Toby-lovers and giving them what they want, which no author should ever do because it's not the fans' story to write? This is why fan fiction exists, so that creative folks don't have to worry about their work being manipulated by the audience.Ranting aside, the switch between characters was often confusing due to a lack in distinct character voices for both main characters, the ending was just random in a way that did not at all flow with the rest of the books, and everyone who is a fan could do without reading Allegiant altogether. It's just not worth it. I won't say I hate it because I do appreciate that we were given some kind of closure and while the random!plot was thrown in, it was an interesting theory to postulate.",2.0

5193,"The story starts out simply enough. Kat Caruso needs to pass her statistics class if she wants to avoid academic probation, but she can't seem to get a single tutor to stick around for very long. Nerdy yet handsome Alec Stone is her last chance...He also happens to be her current boyfriend's best friend and roommate. It shouldn't be hard to keep things platonic, right? She's in a relationship? Well, this is when things start to change for Kat...*insert suggestive eyebrow waggle here*Alec is not only smart, but he's patient and attentive as well. He's truly interested in helping Kat raise her grade and pass her class. And as they spend more time together, their conversations become filled with funny, playful banter.-- She held out her hand, little finger extended.-- &#34;Come on, don't be too cool to pinky swear.&#34;-- &#34;I'm twenty-one years old. I'm not going to pinky swear.&#34;They're clearly physically attracted to each other, too...*dramatic pause*...So, I'll come right out and say it: I was excited to read this book, but the cheating potential/best friend-best friend's girlfriend triangle still made me worry a little bit. (I can get somewhat picky/overly critical about this particular subject.) At times, I didn't know if I wanted to giggle at their chemistry or protest it. I definitely squirmed and let out a few angsty squees!-- Red flags flashed in front of his eyes but he decided at that moment to be color-blind.-- &#34;We crossed the line five minutes ago, didn't we?&#34; he whispered.-- &#34;I think so, because I can't see it anymore,&#34; she whispered back.I think, though, that it ultimately played out and was done in a way that didn't distract from the rest of the story or sink it altogether. Author Megan Erickson let me feel the thrill of lusting after someone you shouldn't want, but she also made me feel the guilt and the turmoil.-- Alec's movements stopped behind her and then his lips returned to her ear, and he whispered in a low, raspy voice, &#34;Kat, we need to stop.&#34;These are characters that just hit their twenties and are still figuring life out. If there's one thing I've learned about New Adult, it's that this phase is rarely easy and always has the potential to get a little (or a lot) messy. It's how these people grow and learn that matters. That is the part that I always love to see, and I definitely got it with Make It Count.Kat's breakthrough stood out the most. Beyond boyfriend struggles, this girl had struggled in school her whole life, but never understood why it was difficult for her. Why was she so different? Alec ended up being the catalyst that she needed in order to overcome her fears and insecurities. I loved following along as she tried to stand on her own two feet, to realize what she's been missing!-- ...she had to stay focused on forgiving herself. On seeing herself. On loving herself.Alec had issues of his own to deal with, as well. Tragedy and betrayal were two things from his past that still affected him, and Alec was more open about them with Kat than he had been with anyone else. In a way, she was his catalyst. I was definitely rooting for Alec to find some peace and happiness.-- He grasped her hand and brought it to rest on his chest, over his heart. &#34;Don't you feel it? All that negative crap I'd been holding inside is gone because of you. And the good I'm filling it with? That's you.&#34;Through the mishaps, I adored the support system of relationships that Kat and Alec each had along the way. Megan Erickson created such a unique, unconventional cast of characters. Flaws. Quirks. Every eccentricity made them so refreshing to read. I wanted to slap big, star-shaped I Appreciate You stickers on all of them! I enjoyed it the most when Kat and Alec went home to their respective families! Those were some truly heartwarming scenes, and I admired the family dynamic on both sides, especially Alec with his mom (*cue the Awww track*) and Kat with her older brother Marcelo (*heartmelt*).This was a fun, yet touching, New Adult read. Make It Count had drama and heartbreak, made me laugh and silly-grin, and even had some hot, in-the-moment steamy scenes! Emotions ran high and all over the place, but the craziness was worth it in the end. Just how college should be! ;) I can't wait to know more about the other students at Bowler University! Max and Lea are up next, and that should be another fun trouble-storm! :)",4.0

Kylie is no longer the new kid on the block; she has been hurt and has shut herself off to almost everyone.  It was hard reading about Kylie going through this but it made all the times that her feisty hotheaded personality come through even more enjoyable!Trace has done a lot of growing up since Girl On Tour and even though I didn&#8217;t think it was possible I fell a little harder for him even after he broke my heart&#8230; I mean Kylie&#8217;s heart at the end of book #2.  After going through rehab to try to make himself into the man he feels Kylie deserves it was heartbreaking to watch them dancing around each other knowing how they felt but being too scared to do anything about it.Even with the misunderstandings about if there was someone new in each of their lives (a.k.a. Hot Tattoo Rocker and Beautiful Rehab partner) Trace still managed to deliver some lines that had me melting.&#8220;But the truth is&#8212;even if you never set foot on that property again so long as you live&#8212;you&#8217;re always there.&#8221; &#8211; Trace CorbinAs much as I absolutely love Kylie and Trace the series just wouldn&#8217;t have been the same without the comic relief provided by Kylie&#8217;s best friend, the hilarious Lulu.&#8220;So if you and Country Ken Doll get yourselves into a mess, I&#8217;ll be there to junk-punch the both of you.&#8221; &#8211; LuluWhile Caisey Quinn put her amazing characters through some difficult twists and turns and Kylie may have strayed from herself for a short while, in the end she found her way back to herself and to the arms she belonged in.&#8220;Loving you is as much a part of me as my music is.

Their story is amazing and I'll never forget them.Some people have left negative reviews on the individual books because of the age difference and him being a minor in book 1. In order to enjoy the series, one has to accept it. I rooted for them, I hoped they could wait, things happened... and they had to happen as they did because if he had been of age they couldn't have been forced apart.

5205,"It was another enjoyable read for me! This is my first time traveling/highland books I've read, so I've been a fan from the beginning.I must say, the storyline was pretty simple and to the point, and being a novella, the story went pretty quickly. It went a little bit too quickly, but it didn't change my opinion much at all.Susanna lived a very rough life, where it made her have a very strong mistrust for all men. Because of her upbringing, a caring man would always be a bastard in her eyes. I did find some scenarios quite unbelievable, like how quick she was to be with Robert and in his bed. I wish it was slowed down a little bit, so I could enjoy their relationship a little bit more. I think their story needed a little more time to play out.Regardless, I am still a fan of the series and author, of course.

5210,"Alyce&#8217;s Thoughts (7 years old):I think the whole book was a pretty good book.  I would spend time reading it to other people like my little brother Nano (4 years old) and if I had more time before I go to bed, I could read it to you and Kat (10 years old).There is lots of pictures that I like and they use thinking bubbles and exclamation points and question marks and periods and a couple of other things I don&#8217;t know the names to.  Some of the pictures have lots and lots of colors.My favorite picture was the whale behind the boat.  My favorite part was when Maya and Filippo were jumping on the trampoline.It was a pretty good book because when Maya and Filippo went to the city they made new friends and jumped on a trampoline and a whole day of good of good things.  Only one really bad thing happened, they ran out of chocolate, because I love chocolate.Mom&#8217;s Thoughts:I thought this was a really cute book with a great message of positivity and focusing on good things throughout.  If you notice, I was able to get my 7 year old to sit down and help me with this review, but my 4 year old wasn&#8217;t in the mood.  I can tell you that he enjoyed it and had fun while I read it to him.  He pointed out various things in the pictures and answered questions that I asked.I have to say one question I asked my kids &#8211; do you ever go off without mommy anywhere, let alone in a strange place you don&#8217;t know?  Noooo.  Good answer.  I know it&#8217;s fiction and all, but you know how literal preschoolers can be.  I wanted to make sure that he got that point.I can also be honest and say that my almost 10 year old poo poo&#8217;ed this as too young for her.  Family reading time is awesome.  She just doesn&#8217;t know what a good time is anymore. :)I think honestly, my 7 year old (1st grade) enjoyed it the most.  She is sitting here reading it to me again as I type up this review.  There are a few words that I have to help her with, but for the most part she is doing a really good job reading it on her own.Cute book with fun illustrations that my youngest two enjoyed is definitely a win to me.Thank you so much for the copy of Maya & Filippo Make Friends in Auckland for me to share with my kiddos.

5214,"Great potential in this first short story! Andrew is a dirty talker, a high-powered lawyer who had some bad experiences in his past which prevents him for dating in the real world. We are just tipping the iceberg of what those bad experiences might have been so I'm hanging by the edge of my seat. He picks up chicks for the night, sex only, on a match.com kind of website. Can you believe it - I've never read a book yet about characters hooking up through these match websites?? But Aubrey &#34;meets&#34; Andrew on a different website, like a Linked In for lawyers so it seems to be more legitimate. What I loved about this story is of course how hot Andrew is! He begins to talk to Aubrey over the phone and through text & he helps her with her career. They actually become good friends which is another thing I believe will hold our couple together in the end. Aubrey could get off just by hearing Andrew's dirty talk through the phone! I loved Andrew even when he was a hypocrite - it seems that Aubrey wasn't honest about who she really is & Andrew hates liars. OK dude, you used a fake name, you meet women all the time just for sex, etc. You aren't exactly honest either! Even when Andrew is angry & mean I loved him which is really good writing I must say. :) The ending just proves how little we know about Andrew's past & it is quite a juicy cliffhanger. But there is so much chemistry between Andrew & Aubrey that I can't wait to find out more!",5.0

So, when I saw an opportunity to read this book, I jumped at the chance.I hadn't read anything by Allison before this, but I will say, that her writing style hooks you right from the start and draws you in. I'm looking forward to going back and reading her previous stories in the All For series. Thankfully, each of these books can be read out of order.All for a Sister was an interesting story that led you down a path to discover what the DuFrane family was truly like and the secrets that had been hidden for years. I loved how each point of view was told in a different way. We are introduced to Celeste, a young girl who had had everything handed to her and she is a might spoiled, but as you read through her life in this story, you can't help but feel bad for her and the life she really lived under all the glitz. Her life was far from perfect. And you got to watch her grow-up as the story progressed, literally and emotionally.Unlike Celeste's character, when we are introduced to Dana and until the end, her story is presented like that of a screen play. We are set up for the scene. I loved how her story unfolded, bit by bit and with the little bit of extra description to her life at the beginning of her chapters. You ache for Dana and the life she is forced to live, but I couldn't help be love how she never looses herself despite the circumstances. She holds tight. Yes, she is a bit fearful from the changes in the world around her, but she is a sweet girl.Finally we see the rest of the story, the holes that we can't figure out in Dana's and Celeste's stories, through Celeste's mom, Marguerite, by that of her will. What a character she is. At first, I felt sorry for her and her loss, but as her character unfolds and you witness her merciless actions, any pity that is felt disappears. The complexity to Marguerite was phenomenal, so when all was exposed, you could feel what Dana and Celeste felt when they to discovered the secrets that had been hidden.All for a Sister kept me turning pages. Each chapter brought something new, whether it was a question or an answer, I had to keep reading.I enjoyed all of these characters. They each played such an important role in the story. The attention to detail was another wonderful bonus to this story that really helped this story pop off of the page. And as I said before, the writing was fantastic. This story offered many twists and turns. When you thought you had it figured out, you were thrown another curve. It kept me glued to the pages.Thank you to Tyndale Blog Network, I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review.",5.0

5218,"It was great fun to read something very different for a change.  Lucy, who has made a mess of things in her life, gets to set things straight by actually meeting the personification of her life, a gentleman named Cosmo. Through their interactions, Lucy comes to some pretty startling terms with herself and the woman she has become in recent years.  I enjoyed how deeply we got to know the character of Lucy, though I did wish not all of her faults were based on lies she had told herself and others. I think the author could have delved a little deeper into how her actions affected the people around her.

I was on vacation in Europe, and actually looked forward to returning to my room at the B&B; - and my tablet so I could see what Sam was up to next.

5232,"I agree with the comments of others about the lack of editing. It is atrocious. If this were the first book by this author I'd read, it would be my last. Having to read through all that crap is annoying in the extreme. But here is what is nearly unforgivable for me. When I was paying $0.99 for an indie author and his error-filled prose, I could get past it if I enjoyed the story. But for $4.99, I am not so forgiving. In fact, Currie's earlier works were not so laden with amateurish mistakes. is it the rush to get the work out that leaves the problems or something else? To me it is like spitting in the reader's eye. If you are going to charge professional rates, produce a professional product. I mean, really...one more pass through the manuscript would have revealed all the mistakes. If YOU don't have time for it, enlist the help of a friend or copy editing service. As I have read all the books in the Odyssey and On Silver Wings series (and the abortion called Seal team 13), I like Currie's work. But it is slipping. Aren't authors supposed to get better with experience?",2.0

I enjoyed the growth of her character and how she learned what truly defines her. Wild and handsome Pan/Parker is a worthy adversary and love interest toward Syrinx/Sylvia. His character's growth warmed my heart. Sylvia's friend Kaye is adorable and at times stole the show along with Rutherford, whom I loved. Dionne's lyrical style is beautiful to read.

5240,"This has been the week of series finale, out of the three I read back to back, Awaken is without the doubt the one that touched me the most simple because it had Liv and Dean, and a beautiful bond of marriage. It's not secret that I'm a huge supporter of happily ever after and not only that, I believe in healthy, passionate, long lasting marriages, and Liv & Dean have that. From the first book, we see them so in love with each other after years of being married, even few hurdles didn't perish the strength of their love, it just made them stronger, and that's what I admire the most about their relationship. I want that with someone someday and it makes me so happy to see that it's achievable. Spiral of Bliss has been my go to romance series whenever I needed a recharge in love and with Awaken being so full of sensuous energy, I can't wait to back to it again.Liv and Dean have been separated for few months due Dean's research in Italy, but mostly because of the scandal &#34;that bitch&#34; is trying to cause. Excuse my language, but I hate that bratty, little, rich, spoiled girl. I hate what she's doing to Dean's career, I hate what she's doing to his marriage; the whole time I was reading this book, I just wanted some to set her straight and not with words. Though about the whole scandal, I loved how the author handled it so realistically, it broke my heart when Dean had to take some tough decisions in order to protect Liv, but that's exactly what makes them the best! Sacrificing your dreams for a loved one is the ultimate form of true love and it might sound sappy or stupid in reality, but I think it's very romantic. One of the main plotline in this entire series has been Liv journey to be independent. She graduated college and married Dean right away, she doesn't have a career like her husband, but finally it Awaken we see Liv opening up her business and doing something for herself and that made me so proud of her. Liv has been a perfect, supportive wife all the time, but it was a fun change to see Dean be that person for her. Not the wife part, obviously :D The only critique I have is Liv's response to her mother, I was completely with Dean on that issue. Why be nice to a person who's so degrading towards your marriage? But in an odd way, I get it. Liv needed that closure and I was glad that she did it in her own way.All in all, Awaken couldn't have ended in a better way. Things got rough in the beginning, but like always Liv and Dean managed to make it through the tunnel alive and together. They didn't let anything break them down and showed the world that happily ever after do exist even after marriage. I loved their story, I loved their romance, and I loved their new beginning. I wish the epilogue was a little longer, but then again I wish the epilogue was an entirely new book because I can't get enough of this couple. Fans of diehard romance need to read this book!

5242,"This book is fun to read.  Two pages each are devoted to each country star, which includes the artist&#8217;s picture, their favorite Bible verse and why they picked it.  This volume gives the reader an insight to each star, and gives a bit of an idea of how the star&#8217;s &#8220;tick.&#8221;These are mini snapshots of real people, so because of that, there were a couple of less than inspiring entries. But for the most part, all have something very inspirational to say.  Included at the end, is the entire book of Mark printed in a very readable version.I always enjoy learning about people, and think a lot can be gleaned when a person shares a personally important Biblical passage.  That is what this book provided, so it was a delight to read.  Lots of the artist&#8217;s thoughts were really heart tugging, and faith-building.  It would be hard for me to pick out just one or two favorites, because I liked so many.  Country stars young, old, and in-between, were featured in this project.  Also included were people new to country music, as well as, long-time favorites.This is a hardback volume and slightly over-sized, just right for a coffee table.  It is a five-star book that would appeal to Christians, and country-music fans alike, and I recommend it.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLook Bloggers &lt;[...]> book review bloggers program.

Although the first one was a Christmas one, and each of the following are appropriately named after the months in which they take place, the only thing connecting them into a series appears to be that they are short engagements and are all novellas.Ir was very enjoyable to read about Madeline, her pen-pal and the humorous misconceptions that drive this story.

I loved her wild t-shirt collection and her &#34;go with it&#34; out look on her position. I loved the idea of a leprechaun being the culprit behind all the mishaps that fell on her ancestors. I loved the houses history and the back story on the treasures hidden. It had so much potential and more than enough right there.What went wrong for me ? The story had more twists, off story side turns than I could keep up with. The racist ghost remarks, didn't fit. The extended family that just keep coming out of the woodwork. I wallowed through their backstory's their horrible lines, without really getting why they were even in the story. Then the most horrendous mother made her appearance. Holy Crackpots, what was that all about ?!??!? The leprechaun turned out to be just a minion for a bigger bad who just flopped into idiot-ville with his cheesy lines actions and stupidity. The this world spun again and our girl of the hour was some special other being, yep a special snowflake. She also had the virginity thrown on her label which never came up as being important to anything in the story it was just mangled into the crazy twirl a whirl.

5268,"It's a nice, hot second-chance romance where the hero and heroine meet 5 years after he left her. They've both grown up and changed and while the attraction between them is as strong as ever, being together is not that easy.This is the story of the other Miller sister, Rosie and in many ways it's similar to Hayley's, too similar, I'd say. A major weakness for me was that it lacked the humour of book 1 and I found Rosie to be more insecure than Hayeley.Rosie was determined to Hunter at bay despite their explosive chemistry. Just like Hayley she tried to keep her feelings out of their affiar and just like Hayeley, she discovered it was impossible. This time around it was Hayeley that helped her sister keep her true love.Rosie was strong and independent, she had overcome her issues but she was clueless how to be in a mature relationship with Hunter. I didn't like how scared of her feelings she was, how unwilling to open her heart to love again.Hunter, on the other hand, was great - determined, going after what he wants and at the same time he was careful with Rosie. I liked how he owned up to his mistakes and wanted a chance to prove his love to her.As with previous book, I found the story too simple and predictable. The characters didn't really win me for their cause and the lack of humour made this a less enjoyable read than Ripped.You can read more of my reviews on my blog - Ellie Reads Fiction",3.0

They only want to &#34;treat&#34; the symptoms and not the cause of the issues.  &#8220;Take a pill &#34; does not solve the problem, only passes it on to someone else. The so called leaders who are supposed to be protecting us and making the world a better place are only lining their own pockets. Money is the root of all evil and does not buy happiness. Every part of society is filled with lies and deceit and most of us follow without question. The children are our future and it scares me to think what the future will really be like, when they leaders are so messed up on drugs they barely know what day it is. The writing of this book was exceptional and very personal. E. Lane Keller is an amazing author and I have become a huge fan.

5284,"I liked this book the least of the series-there are loose plot points, characters dropped without warning, and vast swaths of the novel where nothing happens.  Like the Book of Shadows,  things which should be priorities(For example, in that book,  Diana's magic) are inexplicably ignored for minor plot diversions, to the point that the climax-when it does happen,  is not only disappointing, but convoluted as well.  Maybe it's because the first and second half of the novel seem to be very different; the first half of the novel is much stronger.  In the second half,  the story slows down,  the focus of the entire plot changes,  people seem to do things out of character and Harkness introduces several elements, but then drops them.  The result is a disjointed ending that starts and stops several times.  That being said, I was entertained, but I suspect that Harkness was rushed and didn't quite know how to weave the whole thing together.",3.0

5287,"Aloha, I've recently attended the longevity conference and was grateful for the information Dr. Davis game me about wheat, grasses and grains. However that left me wondering how I could still enjoy cookies and breads. This book came to the rescue! I found it in the library and just tried 2 recipys The seriously chocolate pecan cookies and the Stout bread.For the cookies I doubled the quantity of the ingredients ending up with 6 cups of nut meals.  I had some cashew meal from trader joe's which worked fine instead of pecan flour, (2 cups)  I also added. 2 c. of finely ground walnuts, 1 c. coconut flour and 1 c. almond flour. I am not a fan of stevia or splenda and instead used 1 1/4 c. of Trader Joe's coconut sugar. (plenty sweet for me and most other people with reducing the sweetner) I also had 1/4 c. coconut oil and 1/4 c. of salted butter. I followed the rest of the recipy and had plenty of cookies for the work involved that were absolutely fabulous. The only other change to the instructions may have been the fault of my oven since I had to bake them for about 15 min to get them to be crisp.For the STOUT BREAD I doubled the recipy again to end up with 6 c. of flours.2 c. garbanzo flour, 2 c. golden flaxseed (ground) 1 c. coconut flour 1 c. almond flour. I used a full cream can of Trader Joe's coconut cream ( for the milk) and 1/2 c. salted organic butter and 1/2 c. coconut oil. The followed rest of the ingredient instructions, This made 4 small loaves. I wanted to try something different in 2 of them.  I mixed 1/2 tsp thai spices, 1/2 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp. South african pepper blend (Trader Joe's) divided it and mixed the blend into the top portion of the bread dough for the tiny loaf pans. I then topped with a bit of olive oil.  All of the breads turned out wonderfully and I am so happy with the book I intend to buy it.",5.0
5288,"Where do I begin? Julie Lessman fans, watch out! This book opened with quite a punch! Actually, it was more of a hearty smack of a wooden stick &#8211; wielded by a stubborn, beautiful teacher towards a grouchy, defensive man &#8211; but it grabbed my attention nevertheless. If that doesn&#8217;t jump-start the wheels of curiosity spinning in your head, I don&#8217;t know what will!I was already laughing by the end of the first chapter and I happily hopped on the San Francisco railroad car along with this mismatched pair to see where their &#8220;battle of the wits&#8221; would carry them.I love it when characters are not only fighting their circumstances, but when they&#8217;re also struggling to face the honest truth about themselves and the ones they love. That struggle, the surprise, the surrender. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing.Dare to Love Again truly has it all. The humor, the romantic tension, the surprising plot twists. It entertains and it teaches. It&#8217;s quite a spiritual roller-coaster for Allison and Nick, as well as the rest of the McClare family you&#8217;ve already met in Love At Any Cost.

5299,"I'm hard-pressed to think of a more interesting, likable and wholesome crime-solver than Inspector Ramirez.

I've not been disappointed.  The second book is a continuation of the first story.  So, my advice to you is to read the first in the series, then move on to this one.  In this second book, the author takes on the task of providing the reader with enough information from the first story to help you understand the basis for the characters' actions in the second story, but it is more than a bit overwhelming.  In the first book the author does such a fine job of describing Cuba, that I don't think you should miss it.  She develops her characters very well in the first story, too.  Both add to the pleasure of reading the second book.  Trying to absorb it all in the second book might just leave you dizzy and in overload.",4.0

5308,"This is a wonderful novella.  It's a complete story, and well told.  The characters are fully fleshed and I cared about them.  The love story is beautiful.  A previous reviewer thought that the writing was awful.  I'd have to disagree.  The author wrote sparely, but nothing was left out, or compromised, and the editing was great.  I wish it had been longer, because I really like the characters, and I wanted to know what happened to them, ultimately.  There could very well be a sequel.  But, it didn't end on a cliffhanger.This is a pretty classic story of love and deep ties between different races, or, in this case, different species who happen to share enough DNA to be sexually compatible.  The foundational story is complex, and told sketchily.  We are told just enough to understand the action.  It's enough.  Another reviewer thought that the book was more like an outline than a complete book.  I disagree with that evaluation, as well.  The book is complete.There is, for such a short novel, an amazing amount of personal growth in the main characters, particularly in Ekkatt, the male lead, who has to surmount a lifetime of being told humans are nothing more than insensate beasts.  He finds himself in the unusual circumstance of interacting with a conscious human, who proceeds to destroy all of his established beliefs.  This is the story of Ekkatt and Mari, one of the human women he and his crew have &#34;harvested&#34; from Earth to bring back to the meat markets on his own planet.  He is immediately confronted with the evidence that everything he has been told is a lie, but, of course, resists that knowledge at first.Mari and Ekkatt's story is very romantic.  The love scenes are intensely erotic, but far more sublime than you will see in most romance novels.  There is a sense of wonder within all these scenes (and there are plenty) that is truly exalted.Is it the best book I've read this year?  No, but it's a very lovely story.  It will leave you feeling very satisfied, and it's a book I recommend.",4.0

5315,"I read this book at the suggestion of another Amazon reviewer (thanks, lukevega!) who&#8217;d enjoyed my rave review of Anthony Ryan&#8217;s &#8220;Blood Song&#8221; and thought I might enjoy this Brent Weeks novel too.  He was right: This book fully merits a rave. Weeks has built a complex, self-consistent, believable world of vicious dynastic infighting, sword-and-musket combat, and, most critically, an amazingly well thought-out system of powerful sorcery based on the properties of light and color. We see this largely through the eyes of Kip, a 15 year-old boy whose ordinary problems (drug-addled mother, no father) are suddenly eclipsed when the local satrap slaughters his village and he has to flee for his life. He winds up at &#8220;the Chromeria&#8221; learning to &#8220;draft&#8221; (do color magic) under the tutelage of the legendary Lord Prism, Gavin Guile, who triumphed in the horribly destructive civil war of sixteen years earlier. But that war&#8217;s not really over. Only a tiny handful of people know what REALLY happened to end the war, and now events are spinning out of control again. Gavin reluctantly goes to war, and Kip goes with him; and Gavin&#8217;s old flame Karris White Oak is a prisoner of the enemy (well, AN enemy; there are layers and layers here. Weeks&#8217; plotting is superb).  One of the things I liked best about this book is that in the midst of deadly serious events &#8211; war, death, desperation, heroism &#8211; Weeks will often have somebody say or think something that&#8217;s just laugh-out-loud funny. His characters really have some smarts and subtlety to them. And as I say, the world-building is obsessive, with a map, list of characters, glossary, appendices, the works. Can&#8217;t recommend this book highly enough. (Be aware: The book ends with a bit of a cliffhanger and, like most big, sprawling novels nowadays, most of the storylines are far from wrapped up, because they&#8217;re continued in the next book. Which I will most certainly be buying. )",5.0

5318,"Put Love and Other Foreign Words on your mood or book-funk lifter shelf. I loved this book. It just made me so happy. It's been a while since I've read a book that made me sigh in complete bookish happiness after I finished the last page.Love and Other Foreign Words was a coming-of-age story about sixteen-year-old Josie Sheridan. This novel was smart, hilarious (I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book that my family started giving me funny looks), quirky and very quotable.I loved Josie. I'm sure in real life she'd be very difficult to live with, but she wormed her way into my heart and I had such a fun time with her. I also related to her because I too have a different &#34;language&#34; that I for the different people (from family to friends to work colleagues) in my life.The author captured Josie's voice so well. Her thoughts and the things that came out of her mouth were so funny. She has a genius IQ, but when it came to understanding people there was a lot she did not understand. She kind of reminded me of Christopher Boone from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (although she does not have Asperger's), with her logical brain and preoccupation with languages (Christopher's was with patterns). She saw things unconventionally and she put an offbeat spin to an otherwise predictable plot line that made it fresh and such a joy to read.I enjoyed the secondary characters too, particularly her family. Josie's parents were great. Unlike many YA novels, both of her parents were around, acted like parents as well as added to the hilarity of the novel. If I ever have any kids they were the kind of parents I aspire to be--when Josie got too out of line they were there to reign her in but they let her do her own thing and be herself. The dialogue between Josie and her parents were fantastic. It was also very easy to relate to her bumpy but ultimately loving relationship with her sister, Kate. I saw myself and Leslie when Josie and Kate would argue and make up as only sisters would.As for the romance, it was not the main focus of the novel (for a more romance-focused book read McCahan's I Now Pronounce You Someone Else). The main focus of this novel was Josie as she &#34;translated&#34; and navigated her way through the different relationships in her life. But it was cute and sweet.Take Love and Other Foreign Words to the beach with you this summer. I guarantee you'll have a good time and will laugh your way through it. If you love reading quirky, witty and smart characters, Josie is your girl. I'm looking forward to McCahan's next novel, and hopefully the wait won't be as long this time around.**Originally posted on Michelle & Leslie's Book Picks book blog.",5.0

Once I got past that hurdle, though, it was a great read.  I couldn't wait to get back to it and was sorry when it was over.  As it says, it is a ghost story following two seemingly separate stories, alternating the telling of those stories from chapter to chapter.  Slowly, cleverly, the stories are brought together and it's like a veil being removed.

A chance meeting with Blake and a canceled flight led to an exciting couple of days and the fun was crammed in.Like I said, I could relate to Lydia. I live a lot through books, just like she did. I loved the reoccurring theme and the pep talk she gave herself over and over again--be brave. Sometimes, it's hard to break out of the box, but Lydia realized that sometimes a person has to do that and the satisfaction that comes from doing so is very fulfilling.Blake was awesome! His grandfather knew him well and the lesson he learned was really important. I loved how aware and thoughtful he was, not only towards Lydia, but towards Frankie, too. He was very chivalrous and thoughtful. I loved all the little things he planned to help Lydia out.I've mentioned before how much I enjoy seeing the way this stories connect to one another.

He knows how to write stories that pull you in. This anthology showcases that really well. It's hard for me to pick a favorite from this set because I like them all so much for different reasons.Central Park Song is not your traditional romance, which is refreshing.City Solipsism is a glimpse into the mind of a man on the subway and has one of the funniest endings.The Grand Unified Story tells the story of a meeting between a man and woman and how it's connected to the universe. It's a really sweet story.Waiting For 2000 is a funny play that has characters you won't forget.My Best Valentine's Day. Ever. and My Worst Valentine's Day.

We love Sherlock Holmes because he takes what is before our eyes and makes sense of it.In *The Dinosaur Feather,* answers fast rope down from helicopters like so many commandos.

In Furst's story, Cristi&aacute;n Ferrar, a Spaniard who works at the Paris and New York offices of the prestigious Coudert Brothers international law firm (a real firm, by the way), is recruited to help the Republic by taking part in efforts to smuggle arms to them.Ferrar enlists the help of anyone willing, from the politically committed to the mercenary; high society to laborers. This is very much in the Furst protagonist mode; the reluctant-hero type. Other elements are familiar as well: lots of atmosphere, a variety of oddball side characters, several sexual scenes (not graphically described), the Paris bistro, the nighttime rendezvous that could go either way.If you're already familiar with Furst's novels, you won't find anything new here. I didn't dislike the book, but Furst's work is trending toward the too formulaic.  With one exception, that is.  And that's the trip to Berlin in 1938.  That was gripping. Otherwise, the book left me flat and made me decide to wait for reviews before spending my time on a new Furst book.",3.0
5340,"This book really gives you an insight to the internal structural problems of the greatest house in the country.  It keeps you interested in the many facets of problems that finally came to surface during President Trumans presidency.  It tells of sagging floors, weak beams, falling plaster, and how the previous patchwork repairs finally caught up.  This book also gives historical finds during the repairs such as the burnt beams still used from the 1812 burning of the White House by the British.  Basically, the ONLY part of the house that's original is the 4 outer walls.  Highly recommend this book about renovations in the White House.  Enjoy.",5.0

Inspired by a painting by Max Neumann (which appears in this beautiful volume) of a black, two-dimensional dog of sorts, seemingly flattened in space. The animal inside understands itself to be eternally condemned to captivity and stillness&#8212;what is produced in this monologic delirium are extremely powerful ruminations on the nature of the body, of its imprisoning contours, as well as the repetitions of being conscious. Krasznahorkai achieves a rare tactility in the midst of this language&#8212;his sentences resist easy structuration&#8212;their power is in their very incapacity to be wielded or appropriated in speech. The translation, by Ottilie Mulzet, is of course a remarkable work of art in its own right.",4.0

5353,"Couple of years ago I read the book by Geoffrey Colvin, Talent is Overrated...Its argument was pretty much told by its title: it is hard work and not talent that separates top performers from mediocre ones. Virtually every page of that book made me cringe, because I have seen the evidence, albeit anecdotal, to the contrary, in virtually every area of life. The Sports Gene confirms what I already knew: genetics plays a huge role in success.Everybody knows this: some people have natural ability to do certain things. My neighbor in South Africa was an avid runner, which by itself is not that unusual. The kink is that he also was an avid smoker! Every year he ran Comrades Marathon, an ultra that it  double the distance of the traditional marathon. He was not particularly good at it, probably because he made a few smoking stops during the race. Neither he was training particularly hard for it. Yet getting up and going for 10k run was nothing unusual for him.Anecdotes aside, sports are full of stories of talented athletes, gifted by qualities ranging from strength to endurance to speed, tactical abilities, body types and so on. Sure, hard work is important. However, the sports universe is full of hard working athletes, yet a few make it to the very top. Unfortunately, as it was mentioned in the text, it is has become politically incorrect to mention genetic gifts as determinants of success. I don't know why though: you can still enjoy playing basketball even if you're short, or participate in any other sport you have no talent for.The book leads to another topic, even more politically incorrect. If physical abilities are to a large degree are determined by genes, what about other fields? What about people who speak good English a year after arriving to Australia, while some others struggle with it after having lived here for more than twenty years? Some people are natural mathematicians and have logical minds, while others write poetry and struggle with the concept of annual interest on loan.My point is: genetics is important. It determines a lot of what we can and cannot achieve, both physically and intellectually. My view is not elitist, because I believe that everyone can become good at something. However, you have to be gifted to become number one. Talent is not overrated.",5.0

It was a great way to show nearly everyone getting their happily ever afters... all but one. I am soooo looking forward to Trey's story and I'm really really glad he's opened up somewhat with Leila. In parts I felt there was so much telling rather than showing that I skimmed, but I couldn't skim much for fear I'd miss out on something. I love Jack and Leila's happily ever afters... they are never boring and nothing short of Kleenex worthy. Seriously... when I met Jack in Back-Up I had no idea he'd become this Jack...

I can't wait to read Rhyan's story and I hope he finds his soulmate and she is worthy of him!The only reason I gave this book less than 5 stars was because I felt like Kendra accepted everything with a little too much ease. Otherwise, well done!I did see that other reviewers mentioned that this was supposed to be a Christian book but had issue with the sex and cursing. I just wanted to point out that even Christians curse and have sex.  I say good for you, Ms. Haigwood. Keep doing what you do. Now, off to read the next one!",4.0
5358,"&#34;Face to Face with Jesus&#34; is a powerful and inspirational book.  I found myself face to face with one young Muslim woman's journey as she expressed the effects of Islam on women.  Samaa lived in a war torn country dominated by the communists.  She came from an educated and privileged family.  The war took all of that away but in return she found Jesus through a self-defense ministry in her town.  Jesus offered her, a woman, what Islam could never offer.  He gave her salvation, dignity, acceptance and worth and for that she was willing to accept horrendous punishments from her brothers and father.  In time most of her family would ask Jesus into their lives.  She is to be commended for her persistence.  It would be many years before her father became a believer.Samaa also died in a bomb blast, met Jesus face to face and was sent back to complete the work he has for her.As a woman living in a Western culture,  I have been largely ignorant about the treatment of  woman in much of the rest of the world, especially Islamic cultures.  After reading this book, I know that I am privileged and feel grateful for where I live and how I am treated.

5366,"Wow, I was completely swept away from the very first chapter of Rising Assets by Rebecca Zanetti.  The story kept me riveted to the edge of my seat and as a result, I finished it very quickly.Melanie Jacobs truly enjoys ranching and would love to solve her financial problems in order to manage her ranch full-time.  However, life is fraught with difficulties and set-backs, so in order to make ends meet, she works two jobs in addition to her ranching duties.  She is tired, has a lot on her plate and in addition, if she ever wants to have a baby she has to act now.  Luckily, her two dearest friends from childhood, Colton Freeze and Hawk are around to lend an ear and help out from time to time.  However, Melanie is an independent, single woman that likes to take care of things on her own. Asking for assistance is not typically in her vocabulary.Colton is a successful businessman that wears many hats.  Not only is he gorgeous, Colt is highly educated, runs the financial end of his family's ranch business and is in the process of starting-up a fitness chain, along with Melanie and Hawk. However, a bad investment along the way may deter some of his plans, which Colt is having trouble dealing with because he is the consummate planner of all time.Hawk is a military man and a trained sniper.  Each time he returns from a deployment, he has hardened just a little bit more.  He knows that Melanie and Colt belong together as more than just best friends.  In fact, he is the silent organizer of a bet that is going around town regarding the impending love between them.When Melanie and Colt finally give in to their desires, the entire sky lights up.  The sex is scorching and Colt is a true alpha male.  He is always in charge in the bedroom and much to her surprise, Melanie is loving it.  Their time together is more than just a romp in the hay, it is love. Ms. Zanetti rocks each and every sex scene to the highest level of heat.I really enjoyed this book. To begin with, Colt's family was loving and supportive, which added a lot of emotion to the story. Melanie and Colt are extremely likeable, have great chemistry and challenge each other in the most extraordinary ways. I immediately connected to them as individuals and as a couple. The sex scenes are passionate and hot. This is a brilliant book, complete with great characters, a plot that twists and turns in all the right places, and above all else, a passionate love story.",5.0

But that also led me to have to refer back sometimes to remember who they were because there are a lot of characters to keep track of.Yes, it is sad and it was somewhat of a downer for me reading about the serious illness of one of the characters.  But that might be because I am going through a serious health crisis myself.The only thing that bothered me were all the romantic entanglements.  It seemed that even though one goes through a serious marriage breakup, the right guy comes along and sweeps you off your feet.

5379,"he Mind Cafe is a thought-provoking short story with something to say. The main character, Rosie, is the creation of author Lizzy Ford and a person who would unfortunately be all too easy to find in real life. She suffered an accident in her past (she demarcates time in &#34;BDA&#34; and &#34;ADA&#34; -- &#34;Before or After the Damn Accident&#34;) and has been left in the author's words &#34;a human vegetable.&#34; Rosie is dependent on assisted living, aided by a rude young Guatemalan nurse who can barely speak a lick of English and has MTV playing constantly, which Rosie can't stand. Furthermore, Rosie's only form of communication is a &#34;virtual keyboard&#34; invented by her tech savvy sister that registers her eye movements and clumsily translates them into words on a screen. (I'm unsure if a device like this actually exists, but if not I think it was a clever stroke on the part of Ford. It's very logical and practical piece of technology that should be invented.) With not much joy to be had in the real world, Rosie slips into the Mind Cafe, a place that the reader, or Rosie for that matter, can't fully define. Is it a figment of her imagination or something more spiritual? In any case, Rosie, who while in her dream state has the body of her 24 year-old self except for her silver 60 year-old which she much adores, prefers her Mind Cafe to the MTV playing in her living room, and the narrative of this story focuses on her interactions with the people in the cafe. Some of the diners are important friends and family members and some are people she's never met. I don't want to spoil the conversations because they are the crux of the book, but there is one I want to mention that I thought was cleverly done. A psychologist whom Rosie has never actually met in real life and only knows from a book she read in college visits her to essentially act as her therapist. Interestingly, the man's face never really changes, no smiles or frowns, and that's because Rosie's only seen one photograph of him on the back cover of his book.As far as being a story that asks philosophical questions (What is the meaning of life? Is death a blessing or a curse? etc) The Mind Cafe is excellent. As far as a fiction goes  I still think this is pretty good, but I think sometimes the writing gets a little murky. I found myself having to reread a few passages to understand exactly what it was the author was saying. I think fans of a more Literary-style fiction will be drawn to this as will people who enjoy contemplating philosophy. All in all, The Mind Cafe is a worthwhile read.",4.0

You can tell that Catalina is still a manipulator and I can do without herLo/Marietta-love/hate feelings when it comes to them they both equally get on my nerves but I love there love.

5397,"This is the fifth book that I've read by this author and I enjoyed it.  Her stories are never dull.  I like that there are almost as many stories within each book as there are characters.  I definitely like her style of writing, suspense and drama based on all kinds of twist and turns.",3.0
5398,"I chose this book because it was suggested by my pastor.  If you are interested in Christians in countries where they cannot worship openly, and suffer persecution for their faith, then this is THE book to read.  It opened my eyes to another world.  Also, it touched me in that I needed to make a difference here and now. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes sad, always summons you to the next words, next page and next chapter.",5.0
5399,"There are some mysteries of history that are just incredibly fascinating to me and I love it when fiction authors do their homework and tackle these mysteries with a credible explanation of their own.  The fact that a true life mystery like the Lost Dauphin of France being blended in with a murder that only the redoubtable Sebastian St. Cyr and his intelligent wife, Hero can solve is just bonus.  I love this series both for the cunning mysteries, authentic backdrop and well drawn characters, but the on going reveal of Sebastian's past and the continuing story lines involving the regular supporting cast make each installment a must read.In this story, Sebastian is confronted by the horrid death of a French physician who is part of a secret delegation to London for the purpose of feeling out the chance of a peace treaty.  The only possible witness is a woman who can't remember the event because she was bashed in the head and Sebastian is given a startling turn when he realizes that she is someone from one the darkest moments of his past.In the meanwhile, Hero nears the end of her pregnancy and Sebastian is terrified that he will lose her to the dangers of childbirth.  She is tranquil and confident even encouraging him to stay busy with his investigation which she can't help but dip her finger into as well.  Sebastian slowly but surely tracks down clues and connections even as danger stalks his heels.  It is when the murderer strikes again that people get rattled enough to let go of some rather disturbing secrets that might shake the House of Bourbon in exile if the rumors are true.This was one of the less intense investigations that Sebastian has, but no less engaging for all that.  His private life worrying about Hero and their baby almost makes up for it.  There was not a lack for motives, suspects or even clues for that matter.  Though it didn't all fit together until the final pieces were added in.  I do confess to still only having a vague idea about how the second murder fits in.  It's possible I missed the confirming explanation.  I thought it rather exciting that the Lost Dauphin myth played a huge part in this one and I am now intrigued by Marie-Therese enough to go do further research on her.  Ms. Harris left a nice historical note at the end of the story (which she does in each book actually) discussing a little more about her research.So all in all, it was another great installment in the series and I look forward to the next one.  Historical mystery fans particularly those that feature a husband/wife detective team and a bit of an ongoing personal side story should give these a try.",4.0
5400,I found it very interesting and I learned a lot of the reality of what they accomplished and how they accomplished it.  Also how horrific is was for them as the war progressed and they became the hunted rather than the hunters.  Also how critical it was to defeat them and how it was done.  It is difficult to explain (for me) just how much is covered.  It's a book that I'm glad I got and added to my WW2 library.,5.0

5408,"One More Night is the second novella published by A.M. Willard, and it is the second book in her One Night Trilogy.Ms. Willard's writing is a bit crisper in this second book.  The plot moves along at a better pace than book one of the series, One Night.  Angela has returned home.  She wants to make her marriage work.  In an effort to put some zing back in her marriage or put the sting on her husband's affair, Angela calls his secretary looking for information about Christopher's travel schedule.  She gets that and more.  That fateful phone call is the catalyst for the avalanche that is Christopher's and Angela's imploding marriage.The characters are primarily the same, but as the story evolves, their development increases.  The cheating husband becomes someone worthy of loathing.  The one night stand shows up again, and he may not be the shallow playboy everyone reads about in the tabloids.  Angela grows a spine, and she is much more likable and empathetic in book two.My favorite line from the book-- &#34;...and then we went stale like a carton of milk.&#34;  I appreciate the analogy, and I'm guessing the author has a wry sense of humor.Another good novella from a new author, and that new author, A.M. Willard, is one to keep an eye on.  I'm looking forward to the last book in the trilogy: Forever Night.**This review was done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official.",4.0
5409,"I made it through 154 pages. I enjoy both European History and &#34;old-fashioned&#34; writing styles but this book seemed so dated to me. Groundbreaking for its time, but I just tired of the pedantic rants on medieval logic, philosophy and theology. The author is very knowledgeable on the subject and tries to mix the story with his desire to flaunt his research, but it just didn't work for me.

Makes you rethink a lot of the &#34;history&#34; and facts you may have been fed over the years.

The star, Penny, was delicious as the insecure reporter trying to break into the big time by writing obituaries.  I laughed out loud at many of the lines in this book as the snide and sarcastic remarks brought tears to my eyes.  The author's timing of the quips and responses between the characters was spot-on, so instead of a paltry attempt at being funny, the humor was rich and colorful.Noah, her boss, was priceless as he talked about his children; Ashley's wedding was over-the-top raucous laughter; the family dinner game &#34;would you rather&#34; reminded me of stupid games our family created to break the monotony of family events.The dialogue was engaging and witty and pulled you along in this predictable story.  The characters were introduced well and played their parts to the fullest.  Mark, Nicole, Tallulah, Gregor........all blended into this plot with style and humor.  This is not Pulitzer material but it's fun, fun fun and a great way to spend some reading time.  I enjoyed &#34;Obitchuary&#34;; I hope you do too!",4.0
5436,"This book starts out quick and moves very well.  We have an Earth that has been destroyed by war and those that still live there do so with the help of the Mars Colony where Big Business and Mankind reside.  The author has an interesting concept in how she set up the legal conditions for living on Mars.  Kind of elitist but with opportunity available.  Earth itself is gritty and dangerous and nowhere near the opportunity unless you get notices by the Mars folks.Here we have an Earth born Mercenary team having picked up a mysterious girl that hears things.  They are contracted to bring the girl to Mars.  On their way, they run into others trying to kill them all and pick up a smuggler pilot trying to stay out of the limelight while they complete their mission.There is action, intrigue, politics of a sort, a love (LOVE) interest and very nice character development starting for several of the key folks.I really liked this volume and hope to see the next one soon.",5.0

5438,"There are so many good things about this book, it's hard to list them all.Lets start with the general premise without spoilers:If you've read The Companions, you know that Catti-Brie, Regis, Wulfgar, and Bruenor are alive again and re-united with Drizzt. Their mission (as was hinted before) is to put Thibbledorf Pwent, now a vampire residing in Gauntylgrym, to rest. But that will be complicated because House Xolarrin has taken over Gauntlygrym, remember? This book has a ton of battles and action involving the companions, which is quite satisfying and is the main part of the book, as well as my favorite part. However, it switches off between this and drow characters. There is a lot of intrigue with characters like Quenthel Baenre, Jarlaxle, and Gromph, to name a few. Drizzt's &#34;friends&#34; from the Neverwinter series (Entreri, Dhalia, Afafrenfere, Ambergris, and Effron) are in the novel as well, and some important stuff goes on with them, too.As for the quality of the book:The battles are tense, exciting, and action packed all the way to the end. It's wonderful to see the companions of the hall back together again, and this time around in their second lives I find that they are much more interesting. Regis is the most transformed character, because now he is brave and capable of fighting alongside the others, and is quite useful as well. This is a refreshing thing to see. Catti-Brie is now a cleric/mage and a chosen of Mielikki, which also spices things up a bit since before every member was more or less a fighter. Wulfgar and Bruenor are not as drastically changed, which some readers have complained about. I think it is fine, since there is no need to fix what isn't broken. All in all, everything evens out pretty well.Now for the other half of the book (the drow intrigue). I enjoyed it very much and found it very interesting. If you like the drow, you will not be disappointed. We get to see what is going on in Menzoberranzan, what the houses are doing, who is plotting with who, so on and so forth. If have been recently confused in the Drizzt saga, prepare to become more confused. The book will tease you all the way to the end, hinting at this or that, and never revealing too much. Then right near the end, there are some massive plot twists that will reveal everything. You will get the answers you desperately need. After reading it, you will have a pretty good idea about what the drow are planning and what the general path of the next books will be. This makes for a very gripping read that will have you absorbed right up to the end. And when you finish, you will be satisfied, but awaiting the next Drizzt book VERY eagerly. (It is somewhat of a cliffhanger ending.)To summarize:This book is exciting, tense, stressful at times, interesting, and action-packed. It has something of everything, so that no matter what your favorite aspect of Salvatore's books is, there will be something for you. This novel is a recovery from the terrible mess that was the Neverwinter series. It will renew your faith in Salvatore. For all the disappointed fans, myself included, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.",5.0

I enjoyed all of the books, some more than others, but did enjoy them all.This book just seemed... off from the beginning.I understand that Gooddkind was forced in some ways to match what was was already said in the later SoT novels, I accept this.What was frustrating was the long-long-long bouts of dialogue that didn't add anything - basically the characters repeating themselves or each other.The characters also seemed to solve problems, what a chapter before was insurmountable, with little effort.My biggest beef was the ending though (which I won't give away).  But basically there was a dozen or more chapters that talked about how deadly and unstoppable the bad guys were ... and then in the last chapter or two Magda comes up with a simple idea to beat them...? And then it ends...with just the idea being a &#34;win&#34; enough.  It left me saying &#34;What the ...!!?&#34;I appreciate that Goodkind published this himself (digitally) and for $3 it was an &#34;OK&#34; read.I just found it no where near the &#34;can't stop reading&#34; caliber that the SoT novels had.",3.0

5447,"I got this ARC through Net-Galley for an Honest review.The characters in this novel are Luke Price, and Violet Hayes. Luke has always been the kind of guy who puts a shield on to feel superior. On the outside he wants to look rough, and on the inside he wants to be shown as focused and in order. Luke will do anything to get past his past. He wants anything to distract him as long as he doesn't get to emotional towards anything. But he realizes that whatever he does to block out everything, it will come back ten times worse.Violet Hayes was left with an empty past, literally. She has been left with an unsolved murder case for her parents.  She grew up in foster homes, which damaged her emotionally as well as physically. Her foster parents were either on drugs or just never plain cared about her. She is just looking for someone to want her. She can't stop dreaming about that night, which will haunt her for a very long time, until she gets the closure that she needs.This novel was amazing.

5466,"With Hidden Salem, Kiki Howell has created an intriguing and enjoyable novel with her heroine Makayla, an empath, who is drawn to Salem on the premise of writing a novel amongst its rich historical atmosphere. Almost immediately her empathic gifts are awakened as she walks along the wharf and she is drawn into a previous moment in time, witnessing the past like a vision before her but then unusually she becomes the woman she sees before her, feeling her emotions as intensely as. If they were her own. The experience leaves her dizzy and unsteady on her feet, but the local cop, calm cool and sexy as hell is there to help her recover. However Makayla also becomes aware of some dark and evil energies nearby and this sets the tone for her subsequent time in Salem. Both lines of her encounters develop - the women from the 1700's , who she eventually learns are her ancestors, and the gang of teenage boys who are meddling in some seriously bad dark magic and her planned visit to Salem takes a new direction, underpinned by her growing attraction to the cop, Noah. What particularly appealed to me in the story is the exploration of the mixed blessing of Makayla's gift, and how she struggles with the dilemma of the rather skeptical and uneasy Noah, who she's falling for and confessing to him about  her gifts. Throughout her life only her friend Denise has been aware of what is is for Makayla to live with this ability, and as a result and the pressures that her gift places on her in day to day life, Makayla has drifted through life without much purpose. As a result of meeting Lauri, who instantly is instantly aware of what she is, Makayla starts to learn to control and understand her abilities and in doing so takes back some control over her life.I really enjoyed this paranormal romance and would strongly recommend to others looking to take a dip in this genre, or anyone just wanting to read a good story well written.",5.0

5475,"I just finished reading THE PARIS ARCHITECT by CHARLES BELFOURE (ISBN 978-1402294150, trade paperback, $14.99). I wish I could give it 5 stars but, while the story line is great, the author's technical skills don't live up to the promise.Lucien is a thirty-something modernist architect (think Gropius or Le Corbusier) in 1942 Paris, France. Like others of his skill-set, Lucien is struggling financially. His marriage is childless and crumbling as well. Into his life walks uber-wealthy industrialist Auguste Manet with an offer. Build Manet a &#34;priest hole&#34;  in an apartment for a wealthy friend and Lucien will receive a commission for a new munitions factory from Manet (and for the Nazis). One &#34;priest hole&#34; leads to many and additional factories. The money is very good and much needed.Lucien is sharing a mistress with a Gestapo Colonel that could become problematic. Members of the French Resistance try to act as Lucien's conscience about collaborating with the Germans. The sequences of torture are very graphic and could be upsetting. However, they are necessary. How Lucien interacts with all the various characters - i.e. his mistress, her best friend, the Nazis, his assistant/Nazi spy and his &#34;adopted&#34; son, is entertaining but not well executed.If you are a WWII buff you might well find this aspect of the war intriguing. It is also a page-turner in spite of its faults. I cautiously recommend this book.",3.0

5485,"This is a difficult book to review because it will encourage reactions that have nothing to do with the book's material at all, but rather how a reader applies this knowledge to the present day. So it's easy to go off on tangents, which I couldn't avoid as I wrote this review. The fact that it did connect so well to the present day is a large part of why it deserves five stars. This is not dusty history - this had a direct bearing on who we are today.I would consider this less a biography of Robert Ames than it is using the story of Ames to tell the much larger story of the Mid-East in the 1970s-80s, an era we've basically forgotten. There were lessons that we SHOULD have learned from that time, but we chose other directions.Ames' story is intriguing and nuanced - he was navigating the difficult backrooms of diplomacy, trying to build relationships with high-level PLO officials that he was actually barred from talking with (unless they were paid 'agents' of the CIA). At the same time, Israel intelligence was actively opposed to these contacts, and was essentially trying to subvert any US moves toward normal interactions with PLO figures that Israel considered terrorists.A parallel (and this is a tangent) is Nixon's approach to China, which put the Soviet Union on its heels a little bit. Israel clearly did not want to find themselves as the lesser member of a three-party discussion. So while discussions between the PLO and the US could have helped those nations/organizations come to an understanding, that was not in Israel's interest.Readers who think history began on Sept. 12, 2001 would be well-advised to read carefully the history of Beirut in the 1980s, and some questions will be answered about how we found ourselves in the mess we're in.By invading Lebanon to evict the PLO (after Ames efforts were flatlined by the asassination of his main PLO contact, Hassan Salameh), Israel created a power vacuum that led to the massacre of some 2,500 civilians in a Palestinian refugee camp. To put that in perspective, it's the same number of Palestinians, Shi'a Muslims, etc. as the number of US civilians who died on 9/11. What do you think the response to that would be? We have the answer - the destruction of the US embassy in Beirut that killed Ames and many others, and later the 241 Marines who died in the Marine barracks bombing.Of course, that was 1982-83 - plenty of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israel had occured for decades before that. Ames' contact, Salameh, was suspected of involvement in the 1972 Munich Olympics attack - so of course Israel would target him.It's the perfect definition of a circle of violence, and we're still living in it today.I think author Kai Bird does an amazing job of taking the reader through this convoluted and epically frustrating history. I think he leans a bit too heavily toward ""what might have been"" arguments that I'm not sure history supports. In the 1980s, neither Israel or the PLO were ready to engage each other - add to that Iranian hatred of the US that dated back to our support of the despotic Shah, and then add Syrian nervousness at a Christian, possibly Israel-aligned government on their border, and I don't think peace was coming - whether Ames had lived or not.Another connection to the present day - while there's all sort of raving about ""Benghazi!"" a read of this book reveals the kidnapping and killing of several US diplomats. It happens. But, the US government - for much of it, the Ronald Reagan-led government - did little or nothing in response. Mainly because they didn't know who to target. While there was SOME response to the bombing of the Marine barracks, it was limited to salvos from the USS New Jersey - hardly an invasion of two countries like post-9/11. In fact, one response was a screwed-up car bomb that killed 80 civilians - and those casualties led to the dismantling of the entire 'revenge' effort; compare that to how we attack with drones today, where common civilian casualties are barely discussed. Do we think there will never be a cost? That the 'other side' is simply going to forget?The 70s-80s governments had plenty of flaws, but Nixon, Carter and Reagan recognized that the US had global responsibilities and had to keep things in perspective - the nation could not go off half-cocked on crazed foreign misadventures. We had to take our lumps and navigate the rough water as best we could. Unfortunately, that lesson in perspective and unintended consequences was ignored by subsequent administrations; and look what happened.Of course, had we responded more forcefully in 1983, maybe Bin Laden never rises above a local despot in an Afghan mountain town. Or maybe we bomb Soviet ally Syria and it escalates into tactical nukes over Europe. You never know.This is a great book, not just for the upclose look at an unheralded US agent, but for a history to which we would do well to pay better attention.",5.0

5489,"I get that it's time for Eve to evolve into a happier person and that's isn't my problem with this book. My problem is the dialogue is weird and the writing somewhat disjointed. The plot is okay, not great, but there doesn't seem to be any real depth of connection or emotion that is usually front and center.I could deal with all of the things that seem a bit off except for one and it really bugs me. I mentioned it in a comment on another review. The book refers to the button that Roarke carries in his pocket and says it was from a gray coat that Eve was wearing. How could the author or editor get that wrong? The incident in which Roarke gets that button is referred to in many of the books. It wasn't a gray coat, it was an ill-fitting, ugly gray suit. Seriously, how can I know the storyline better than the author? Is that a minor detail?  Maybe, but it's very telling to me. It reminds me of another major storyline faux paux in Midnight in Death where chief medical examiner Morris is called Morse repeatedly. Whose editing these books?I've become increasingly disenchanted with the writing in this series but can't seem to kick my addiction so I'll probably buy the next book.",3.0

5491,"3.5 starsI have been a fan of Lisa See for a long time and have read all her books. I was really looking forward to this one as it was set in San Francisco during WWII. This was a hard time for everyone especially the Japanese who were put in internment camps. The book tells the story of three girls who are out to make their name and fortune in show business. Grace was raised in the Mid-west and knew no other Orientals. Ruby was raised in a rambunctious family in Hawaii and has no known inhibitions. Helen was raised in a traditional Chinese family and still lives at home.It is interesting to see how these girls make their way with very limited opportunities. It really deals with the rampant discrimination of the times. They were really path setters as most women stayed at home and didn't work. Then the war came and all of a sudden women were able to work. The story deals with the war times and internment  and people passing themselves off as someone they are not.So what bothered me? I found it hard to believe these girls were friends. They were quite mean and manipulating to each other. They fought over men and work. They fought over family secrets and money. In fact, there was nothing they didn't fight about. There were instances of abuse that seemed unrealistic and unnecessary. The main love interest, Joe, is really unappealing. I didn't understand the attraction at all.Still, Lisa See is a great writer. The book deals with a lot of issues and explores an area that I knew little about. It's an alright book just not one of her best.",3.0

This is my first time reading this author and I was really impressed!I LOVED the story line, the characters and the author did an EXCELLENT job of building up the characters and I could truly feel the connection between Ryke and Kate.The characters both suffered big losses in their lives and they met in a grief group.  They initially connected because they have a mutual heat break and they understand each other and don't have to pretend that they are OK. Through this connection they are also drawn to each other and the sparks really start to fly.Ryke is a ultra sex hockey player and he hires Kate to be his assistant. The more they are around each other, the more the sexual chemistry and sparks start to explode.  They try to fight it, but some things can't be denied!!!I really loved this book!  It had it all.

Samantha and Ryan (main couple) then their sidekicks.. Hannah and Jake.. Samantha is a woman of today- professional, works hard in a mostly male profession but makes her way, feisty and not an angel but not crazy either.. She had a fantasy... Ryan.. And for 10 years she fought it and ran from him but he had a fantasy too- Samantha.. Now being back from Iraq and a horrible near death experience out there they both get that second chance to make that fantasy come true.. Not giving any spoilers away- I liked the passion, the way things happened naturally with them as well as Hannah and Jake.. Why this is 4 instead of 5 stars- something misses with the flow or too much is left not addressed. For example the feeling of Ryan not being apart of a family because he was raised in the foster care system when clearly Samantha's family loved him as family... He felt disconnected in that sense and they should have had the opportunity to clear the air with that one. I think he needed that. The case about the drugs... What happened?

5502,"~ 3 Stars~Hunter Kiss is the Prequel to the Hunter Kiss series by Marjorie M. Liu. I recommend reading this before you start The Iron Hunt book 1. Hunter Kiss is full of action, romance, in the non-traditional sense, and intrigue from beginning to end.The prequel is written POV and explains about Maxine, her background story, as well as her meeting Grant. She is someone who has no home, no roots and avoids men like the plague. She sure did fall into bed with Grant very quickly and I did not feel that much chemistry between them. Not to sure about this relationship. Will see how the books work this one out.Maxine also has tattoos that come to life when the sun sets and these tattoos are no ordinary tattoos.  The author explains the myriad species of spirits and demons who have invade this world. Humans who are possessed and that Maxine can see them.The story was interesting. The writing style though made the book feel more formal and old fashioned. It's not in the past nor was it decades ago. This style made the story move more slowly and hard for me to connect to the characters. I plan to read Iron Hunt and see what happens next, though I'm not in a big hurry to check it out.",3.0

But, thankfully, just like the title of the book, Bender, I too was thrown a curve ball.Keegan is a 20-year-old college student struggling to focus on school and reach her goals while living at home with her mom and younger sister.  Over the years her mom, a single parent, has relied on Keegan to help raise her younger sister Sara and now she is at her breaking point realizing she has to start looking out for herself.In an effort to take control of her own life, Keegan decides to find a place of her own.  She comes across an ad for a roommate that works with her budget and is close to school.  When she and her best friend go to take a look, not only do they find the perfect home, but she is lucky enough to be sharing this home with a hottie!The title of the book is a baseball reference which translates into a curve ball; Keegan is thrown many benders as she navigates her new freedom, new relationships and her new roommate, Camden.Bender is the first book in a four-part series and can be read as a stand alone.  The other books in the series will be about Camden&#8217;s brothers.I think I liked this book because I needed something that was just easy and light reading.

You do need to read book one in order to understand where this book is, otherwise it will be like a cross-country trip with Tom-Tom, you&#8217;ll get to leave Indianapolis three times. (True story, thanks Tom-Tom) It&#8217;s quite confusing, frustrating, and you&#8217;ll be lucky if you don&#8217;t strangle whomever you are traveling with. Wars have started over less, so save some trouble and read book one first, okay?I really enjoyed book one. I thought that the storyline was more on the original side than anything I had recently read when it came through. It was a bit on the &#8220;soft&#8221; side considering it was about slavery and forbidden love, but it was worth the read. Now, book two picks up where book one left off. We have Savannah feeling horrible that the love of her life, Kayden (the slave), was sent back to be retrained at the Compound. (The Compound is where slaves are born and trained.) Instead of going to jail (you&#8217;ll just have to read book one to know why) she picks going to the Compound instead so she can be with her true love Kayden.I&#8217;m slightly less than excitable about this book. The reason being the naivety that made Savannah lovable in book one, really annoyed me in book two. It was obvious that &#8220;humans&#8221; didn&#8217;t view the &#8220;neanderthals&#8221; as people at all on the outside of the Compound so it shouldn&#8217;t have shocked her that they were treated worse than rats in a cage. I mean, come on already.And the completely sweet, endearing amazement that Kayden had in book one that a human could love a slave?! It was so over the top in this book that I wanted to cry in frustration. Their relationship was just over-wrought with flowery confessions from him and out of the blue carnal desires from her. I mean who really feels like humping while in the worst kind of jail cell imaginable with a couple &#8220;troublemaking&#8221; slaves to watch. Sounds like a fun go round eh?Now as for the story as a whole. It had a ton of potential. It could have taken the dark erotic genre by storm and been what all other authors in the genre aspire to be, but at every turn it felt like the author got scared of where she was going and backed out before it went there. It was a confused and jumbled storyline that really left me feeling bereft. I will go ahead and let you know that the ending for the book made finishing the story/series worthwhile. I&#8217;m always game for a good HEA and Savannah and Kayden get theirs. It&#8217;s just the getting there that was bumpy.I give the storyline in this book three stars and the smutty parts are two steamy-ish panties. Not quite damp&#8230; but not bone dry either.A Mommy&#8217;s a Book Whore review.",3.0

Rylan, her sister's boyfriend was cleared as a suspect, but the suspicion of guilt was still a cloud over his head, as the murder had never been solved.The writer laid a foundation and built upon it with mystery, romance, and some sexual heat. This was a fast paced mystery that kept you intrigued as the story developed.My only 'Cons' to this book did not keep me from giving it a five star review.1. It was mentioned that Macie's parents still suspected Rylan of being involved in Karen's murder. I think it would have been interesting to know their reaction to Macie and Dylan's relationship.2.  I would have liked more detail about the person who committed the crime and how/why it was done. Don't get me wrong, the information is provided. I would just like to have been given more detail.3.

Well I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll ever really be in check since she&#8217;ll always have the desire, but she seems to be accepting that and working on moving on. This book covers more of Damien&#8217;s secrets and while he works to deal with them in his own way. Most importantly though, Damien is back in full force. He still has all those controlling things we&#8217;ve grown to love in our alpha-males.The book isn&#8217;t without some flaws. As much as I love the series I wouldn&#8217;t be doing the site justice if I didn&#8217;t mention them. There are a few small continuity errors from book 1 and 2, nothing horrible.  There are also some of the typical romance novel issues, lip licking things of that nature.One thing I love about how J. Kenner writes is her ability to really set a scene. The descriptions that she writes are amazing. There are times it&#8217;s almost too much. Nothing really &#8220;thrilling&#8221; happens in Claim Me. There are no car chases or bombings, but more secrets are revealed. Relationships are tested. The reading becomes more about their personal connection than what physical threat they will survive through.As always the sex is great. There is some kink but not 50&#8242;s kink. Just sexy kink. :)I think that&#8217;s part of why I love this story so much, it&#8217;s almost normal. Just the two of them working through their problems and learning to grow together. It&#8217;s not rip your heart out turmoil, but it&#8217;s also not super fluff. The whole Stark Trilogy finds a nice middle ground and rides it out.",5.0

5531,"Poor Dr. Shannon Frasier is really having a bad couple of days.  During a dinner party at her house, a man is shot and killed in front of her house.  Then her junkie sister shows up for an extended visit.  On top of all that, her father has a serious health crisis.  All that would be bad enough, but then a threatening anonymous caller begins harassing her to find out what the murder victim on her front yard said before expiring.Shannon has even bigger problems, because when she was in medical school, her fiance was shot and died in her arms.  Although she was in the process of becoming a doctor, she was powerless to save her wounded fiance.  That left her with doubts about her abilities, as well as something of a &#34;post traumatic&#34; response when she encounters gunshot victims in her work.  She does have a new boyfriend, pathologist Dr. Mark Gilbert.  Her unresolved feelings for her dead fiance, however, are also preventing her from moving forward in her latest relationship.Things get a more complicated when it turns out that Shannon's sister Megan, who hasn't been out of rehab for very long, knew the dead man.  They had been in rehab together, so the victim was also a pretty sketchy guy.  Megan was fleeing yet another abusive relationship when she asked Shannon to take her in.  When Megan's boyfriend also turns up dead, the police begin to question whether the Frasier sisters don't know more than they're telling.  An interesting complication occurs when the investigating officer seems to have more than a professional interest in Shannnon.Eventually, the mysterious caller makes personal contact in frightening and increasingly violent ways.  Mark urges Shannon to get a gun, but given her tragic history with firearms, she's unwilling to consider the subject.  All of this stress also begins to take a toll on her professional life as well.The book did lead up to a pretty thrilling conclusion, and the story moved along at a rapid pace.  Shannon's relationship with Mark, who is much more religious than she is (even with a pastor as a father!) also develops in an interesting manner.  The two shootings (the boyfriend and the front lawn guy) are both sort of glossed over and not really explored much, to my mind.  Of course, those are sort of peripheral events, but still, I would have liked them to be explained and tied up in a neater fashion.  That's a small quibble with an otherwise enjoyable and suspenseful read!I received a copy of Critical Condition from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for this review.",3.0

5540,"After China unleashes what is dubbed the Eleventh Plague, or P11, the United States has collapsed and all that is left are salvagers roaming in tiny groups, slavers searching for people to kidnap, loosely affiliated military groups, and small settlements where people try to recreate what they remember from before the Collapse. Stephen is part of a salvager family now made up of just himself and his father. After a freak accident gravely injures his father, Stephen joins a small settlement, but is very distrustful and always wants to run.Slowly, Stephen discovers that there are others like him, bearing the scars of their dystopian world. The Eleventh Plague is a story of friendship and the invisible chains that bind us to others and finding your own path and not always doing what others expect you to do. The book is an easy, quick read. There are a few twists and turns here and there making it very hard to put it down. I loved it!",5.0
5541,"New York author T. Wrage fulfills her passion for writing with this well constructed novel THE BED AND BREAKFAST, her fourth novel: as she states, `the drive and desire to create places and characters with depth, where readers can go and escape the hardships that life sometimes thrusts upon them is my greatest aspiration.'In this novel T. Wrage creates a story whose main character is actually a place - the Victorian style 100+ year old elegant home built by a doctor and boasts seven bedroom suites, two on each floor, has gained the sheen of a well tendered antique through the years and is now a Bed and Breakfast, the Discovery Inn. Wrage describes the house in detail before introducing the owner and the house tenders who make this a most desirable Vermont escape for couples - a place where many people come to find solace, romance, and peaceful tranquility, which they find easily within the walls designed with comfort in mind fill its promises. There is a delightful hitch: the spirit of the deceased Doctor Watson remains in the house, not a frightful spirit but a congenial `host'. Wrage introduces the guests room by room with just enough history to make them credible and early on allows the house ghost/spirit to enter the story with another bit of history: ""It was the coldest day on record for a December that anyone could remember, when a figure of a man appeared in the home of the deceased Doctor Watson. His wife who survives him stated, ""He appeared right in front of me as though he were still alive, I stood there stunned and he reached out to me, as I fell to my knees in disbelief, he disappeared as quickly as he had shown himself."" Perry [the current owner] looked up from the clipping and added, ""This was the first encounter with the good doctor and from this day on, he has continued to be seen in the house, we really do not know why he continues to dwell here, we only know he does.""Basically this is a romance novel that deals with the daily routines of the visiting guests and their interactions both with each other and with the other guests, but there is a mystery afoot that involves the spirit(s) and that is the driving force that makes T. Wrage's novel takes flight. She manages to invite the reader into the atmosphere she has so carefully described so that the arrival of the new spirit (and the tale of murder) holds the well-prepared attention until the mystery is manifest. This is a solid little book, not in the class with the Great American Novel, but on that will most assuredly provide the reader with an enthralling adventure for those quiet nights of curling up with a good book.

I'm speechless, mind-f****d, and deeply disturbed! WOW!Sadie has the perfect husband, perfect family, perfect life. Well that's the impression I got. Then she opens her journal... I had several different opinions of Sadie, at first I thought she was just in a deep depression. And I kept thinking;  Why? What's so awful about her life? Why does she dance with death so often? My Dear Stranger starts showing up when Sadie is 16 years old. Please stay with me, I might start rambling. AT FIRST, I think Stranger is comforting, loving, maybe even healing...He shows up, then he's gone again. Leaving me wondering if he's real. Is he real?Sadie is complex, complicated, crazy, I think. I was questioning my sanity, while hanging out in Sadie's head. I honestly had no idea what was to come. What was reality? Is she suffering from split personality disorder? WHAT'S REAL?The whole book kept me guessing. I was wrapped and trapped into the story, looking for clues, anything!!! And even after I finished, I am still thinking back wondering if I missed something.MY DEAR STRANGER- at the back of my mind I kept making guesses. At one point I thought Sadie might be My Dear Stranger. That's how screwed my mind was. I guessed you once, but through my confusion, I totally forgot. I WAS SHOCKED!

5546,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I'm a sucker for a good YA read, and this book really blew me away.  I had originally picked it up for a short read but immediately found myself unable to stop.  The writing and pacing in the book trick you into reading for much longer than originally intended!I loved this story and am even willing to forgive a cliffhanger ending to issue it a full 5 star rating.  Della is a beautifully broken foster kid who, upon reaching her 18th birthday, finds out she who her mother is and that she's inherited a house in North Carolina.  Poor Della ends up learning a lot more about her family and the inheritance of some truly amazing powers.  The family she stumbles into was one of the best parts of the book.  The heart and warmth between all of those characters was so genuine and &#34;real,&#34; even when the circumstances were rather magical.Oh, and of course the book has some yummy YA romance as a bonus.  Through Della's new cousin, Cash, we meet Dove.  He's your typical hottie, with brains and some of his own unique powers.  While Della is trying to find herself, she still has time to notice this boy, for which I am thankful.  Here's hoping the next book gives even more of this wonderful tale and it has lots more action and romance to come.",5.0

5552,"I have read a few books on this topic written for mortals like me & this has been by far the best book that explained the topic to most part. The idea behind the book is that this very complex and intriguing topic would be explained in simple terms with the reader being asked to understand Pythagoras theorem only. The idea of clocks moving slowly is explained really well with this approach but the best explanation in my view is the concept of absolute space, while I did not feel the same about space-time, even though the author had made immense effort to do so. While I understand the topic is too complex without fundamental understanding basic algebra the premise of knowing only Pythagoras theorem is very short lived in the book, also I would have liked to more about Newton&#8217;s view of space and time than what is made available in the book, still I commend the author for writing such a great book and recommend this book as best starter on this topic.",4.0

Getting older sucks, and well here is a rediscovery of life, love, and so much more.Fans of fiction will find this to be a heartwarming, and beautiful novel with a lot of heart at the helm. There are moments of comedy, surprise, and many other elements to find here. I definitely enjoyed it and found the condensed version appealing and wonderful all the same.

5557,"I really enjoyed No Strings Attached, so I knew I&#8217;d probably enjoy Tempted by the Soldier. Who can resist a broken war hero and an insecure woman with trust issues that have smoking hot chemistry? I know I certainly can&#8217;t. I really liked Nate and Lilly from the start. Lilly is ridiculously feisty and has a giant chip on her shoulder where Nate is concerned and rightfully so. The banter between these two is spectacular and really amped things up in the story. The sexual chemistry is also off the charts, even when I was feeling so bad for Lilly because Nate was a jerkface.Nicolette Day does an amazing job of delving into both Nate and Lilly&#8217;s issues. Nate is really broken to the point of feeling guilty for being alive. Lilly&#8217;s mother did a number on her, leaving her afraid of being abandoned again and not trusting those around her. The way feelings grow between these two is great and I loved watching them both start to deal with their deep seated problems. Of course they all weren&#8217;t figured out overnight, but they weren&#8217;t just swept under the rug either.I look forward to reading more by Nicolette.

5562,"WARNING: This novella contains explicit sex scenes (including BDSM) and is for mature 18+ readers only.So I met Megan Keith at the Indie Authors Down Under event at the Gold coast in March... I found a lot of new authors and got lots of new books to read... and I was lucky in that this was available free that weekend and I have finally gotten around to reading Eraser!This book has given me a new meaning to &#34;Yes Sir&#34; - this is a short Novella that packs a punch. It covers BDSM so as the warning in the synopsis says if this type of content offends you this book is not for you.The story is about Mackenzie who works in a bar, one of the patrons is a mysterious man who visits once a week. He orders the same drink, scotch on the rocks, (a man with taste - I love the brand that he drinks!) He drinks alone, but he never leaves that way.But this time he has turned his attention on Mackenzie. Instead of feeling nervous Mackenzie is enthralled, intrigued&#8230; and aroused.Mackenzie has felt attracted to this man since he walked into the bar, so when he tells her to sit and have a drink with him, she does.This Novella is a great example of a short read with great erotic writing and I would say to anyone who likes this genre to one-click.totally awesomeQuoting Megan - &#34;This was originally written as a stand alone short story but after numerous requests for more, it has recently been turned into a series.

5568,"I nestled down with Leviathan, expecting to be drawn into a world of hold-on-to-your-seat thrills. First, the novel was written by Tim Curran, and the guy never disappoints. The cover also displayed a prehistoric marine reptile &#8211; you don&#8217;t get many of them in stories these days. I am a long time dinosaur-fanatic, dating back to pre-school. I have always held a special place in my heart for plesiosaurus and ichthyosaurus, those prehistoric monsters residing in the depths of the ancient oceans. I also love beaches on the Atlantic. So, prehistoric marine reptiles invading a small island on the eastern seaboard? What&#8217;s not to like?The book surpassed my anticipated pleasure. The reptiles were superbly described, the seaside descriptions had the right feel (although, I think Mr. Curran was envisioning a Pacific beach with rock cliffs when he wrote the book &#8211; not the smooth sandy beaches of the southeastern United States where the action was taking place), and the plot was downright creative. He had to get these reptiles appearing in the present day &#8211; and he came up with a doozy of an explanation for their appearance. The description of the creature doing battle with a lighthouse was reminiscent of the classic short story The Fog Horn by Ray Bradbury. Then, of course, is the mandatory attack on the village&#8230; a dinosaur lover&#8217;s dream, and the description is to &#8220;die for&#8221;. Is the plot fairly predictable?

5572,"Cael McAvoy and his friends live in the Heartland, where corn grows in spades, but Heartland&#8217;s people can&#8217;t eat it. In fact, some would say the corn is alive. One thing is for sure, it fuels everything that the Empyreans need, in their kingdom in the clouds, while Heartland&#8217;s citizens survive on scraps, because the land can&#8217;t grow anything else. Cael is, however, captain of the Big Sky Scavengers, and they&#8217;re pretty darn good at what they do, even if the mayor&#8217;s son and his crew constantly try to sabotage them. Life is hard, but not terrible, until the love of his life, Gwennie, gets Obligated to someone else, someone he hates. Soon, however, Cael and his friends discover a patch of fresh veggies and fruit growing amidst the corn, and what it signifies could change the lives of the Heartlanders, but what to do? If Cael thought life was interesting before, it&#8217;s about to get downright scary, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t help that his sister has run away, leaving him with a father that he feels does nothing to help the family and a mother who is crippled by tumors.Most of you know by now that I love anything that Chuck Wendig writes, and his first foray into YA is a winner, inside and out. I love the world of the Heartland, where corn will attack you if you linger too long in the fields and the Blight can strike anyone at any time, causing horrible mutations and, sometimes, insanity. If you&#8217;re already a fan of his work, you know how good Wendig is at imagery, and it&#8217;s on fine display here, in this post- apocalyptic world that echoes, in some ways, the Wild West, but with hoverboards and of course, killer corn. Perhaps among one of the creepiest elements of this book is the Lottery, which one family wins every year, awarding the winner a trip to the sky, to live in promised luxury. Yet, the reader gets the distinct impression that heading to the clouds may not be all it&#8217;s cracked up to be, but you won&#8217;t find out in this installment. Since Cael&#8217;s sister has hitched a ride into the sky, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll find out more in the next book, but the wait will be excruciating, at least for this reader. If you like your dystopian heavy on the creepy, with plenty of rebellious and strong characters, you&#8217;re in for a real treat. This one will appeal to teens and adults alike, and it&#8217;s not to be missed!",5.0

5576,"Blood Song, perhaps the most enjoyable book I've read during my 20 years of reading fantasy. I was very excited when Tower Lord was finally published, eager with anticipation. Now, I can only shake my head with frustration and sorrow. I don't like to give 2 star review to this book, especially since its obvious that Ryan, alongside with Sanderson and Rothfuss is the top notch fantasy writers of our time. But I hope that he and his publishers will read these reviews, and re-think the direction of future books!- Tower lord introduced multiple new point of views, whilst Vaelin only got a few shallow chapters, the story focuses strongly on new main characters.- It was very hard to remember all the new characters names, creating lots of confusion. As a reader we encounter lots of battles and tragedies, ultimately failing to create any emotional reaction.- Whilst Blood Song felt almost unnaturally well written, sucking the readers emotional invest into every page and character, Tower Lord does none of this. Instead it feels like we're introduced with lots of side stories and page filling story arches.I remember reading somewhere that Ryan had already finished writing the whole series before publishing Blood Song. My educated guess says that the publishers wanted to stretch the story, make more money and forcing Ryan to re-write his drafts on tower lord, becoming this George R.R. Martin alike standard clone. Why try to mimic George R.R. Martin now, when Blood Song has already shown to be much better..? I sincerely hope that Tower Lord will be republished in the version Ryan wrote as a self published author!Greetings from Finland.",2.0
5577,"In the land of Merenia, trouble is brewing. It all begins with unseasonably cold weather and a slain merman. Kidnapping, treachery, and magic combine to make this book a fantastic start to an epic fantasy.This book has several storylines branching out and re-converging as the author takes us on an epic journey. In a land where trolls attack travelers, where warring factions of mermaids battle to take control of a ancient prophecy, and where treacherous noblemen seek to overthrow the King, three siblings are faced with dangers they never knew existed. Rich folklore in this fantasy world comes to life as stories become reality for the three Castlecray children.This first book in the MER series was immediately captivating and very easy to read. I was swept away by the author's rich imagination, and this story was as imaginative as they come. I loved the characters in this story, particularly the Castlecray children, their old sea-faring grandfather, Noam, and both the King's sons. There is a beautiful, magical quality to this tale and I'll definitely read the next book in the series.I'd give this book 4.5 stars out of 5 because there are parts where it could have been edited better. Some of the descriptions are excessive, and this sometimes slowed the pacing. Overall, I thought this was a marvelously inventive book that I would recommend to fantasy lovers ages twelve and older.",5.0

I felt like I was experiencing the fair myself.I enjoyed the complete story but I really appreciated how much history filled this fictional story.  I felt like there was so much in this book and it and it had a perfect balance of fiction and history. I liked how Billy, the woman doctor... which wasn't popular at this time... and Hunter, the ranger, got past all of their frustrations and worked together with a share passion.They saw what was happening with young children, thanks to an infant being abandoned. As they were trying to find a place for this baby, their eyes were opened to the crimes being committed by young children.  They were determined to figure how they could help change the lives of these children who were left in such hopeless situations.On a side note, I really like the cover of this book.

Tina's book opened my eyes and my soul to areas I had thought I had clarity around my faith. I realized quickly into her book that I was still making choices based on beliefs from my religious upbringing. That is not to say those beliefs were wrong, just that they were not the whole picture and that they no longer served me. I was working from a lot of guilt places. I am beginning to see how I can let that go. Reading this book and working through the well thought out and insight filled exercises has helped me open new pathways for moving forward in my life. I learned new questions to ask that unlocked a deeper connection to my spirit.

5594,"If you are looking for a story that has pulse-pounding suspense, a love destined by fate, and a twist you never saw coming, then Chaysing Dreams is your perfect choice. Fate has a funny way of twisting and entwining the chords of our lives. What we carefully plan for our life is sometimes dismantled thread by thread until we are facing that which we have carefully ignored and hidden away. Fate is a cruel master, but a sweet friend. Choose thoughtfully and wisely the path you follow and always trust your instincts.Tess is considered an above average student, a very talented athlete, and a wonderful daughter and friend. While things in her life like school and sports seem to come easy for her, the only problem that she has is a reoccurring nightmare that she just can&#8217;t shake. In her dream she is running away from an unknown evil that is relentlessly pursuing her. She doesn&#8217;t understand what the dream means, but she can never forget the terror that it instills in her heart. As time passes, she comes across another confusing bump in her otherwise perfect life. His name is Chris. She is drawn to him in a way that she can&#8217;t explain, and no matter how hard she tries to get to know him, he continually draws her in only to push her away. Her disappointment simmers until she can take no more, and the explosion that follows will change her world forever.I very much enjoyed discovering the characters with the pages of this book. Each of them brought a special piece to the amazing mosaic that took shape before my eyes. Of all of the characters, Tess really touched me the most. I found her to be a very believable and beautiful character. It&#8217;s very easy to identify with her throughout her journey. She longs to live a full life, and in her mind that means meeting and exceeding all of her goals.  She doesn&#8217;t factor love into her plans, and as a result, her world is turned upside down when love makes its grand entrance and begins to show her what she is missing out on. The chaos that Chris brings with him sends her mind into a wild frenzy, but once she is able to understand and accept her feelings toward him as genuine, she is then free to return his love. What she receives in return will transform her life and shape her into the extraordinary person that she was always meant to be.The pace was a little slow in the beginning, but once it picked up, there was no stopping it. The suspense and mystery that surrounds Chris and Tess will pull you in as you fall under their spell of heartache and strength. You will want to learn all of their secrets, but the truth always comes with danger as these secrets were never meant to see the light of day. I very much enjoyed reading this story, and I look forward to the next book in this trilogy.",4.0
5595,"As a career manager in organizations obsessed with managing by buzzword, I am delighted to find such a scholarly and experienced concurring opinion. The book alternates between recounting the dismal evolution of &#34;scientific&#34; management and a memoir of the author's personal experience as a management consultant.

On his own, he fought the Japanese from a Curtiss P-40 that he 'liberated'. With the enemy so near, he had many targets, as long as he used hit and run techniques.

It definitely drew me in.The only issue I had which was a small one but did affect my rating was that I found some scenes drawn out to the point I kept saying &#8220;come on get on with it&#8221;, which in turn I skipped reading some paragraphs.

5602,"RAINING MEN AND CORPSES is the first book of the Raina Sun Murder Mystery Series.This light and entertaining tale is by turns funny, quirky, and sigh-worthy.  Heroine Raina Sun is a graduate student with a lot on her plate, so it stands to reason that the one thing she doesn&#8217;t need to add to the mix is murder.  But we all know how it is &#8211; just about the time you&#8217;re managing to juggle everything life serves up with a little finesse, here comes a flaming ball of&#8230; well, a flaming ball, and our girl gets a bunch of them.  This leaves Raina juggling grad school, lack-a-money-itis, campus intrigue, friendship challenges, family secrets, a runaway grandmother, AND a hunky ex, along with that previously mentioned murder.Tan looks at all of this with humor and more than a touch of drama.  Without delivering any spoilers, I can tell you that Anne R.

5604,"Sometimes I think the beauty of the passing years is that gradually you begin to care less about what other people think about you. It's very freeing. Although, come to think of it, maybe it's a bad thing, too!So, perhaps you think you don't have anything to learn from this book. But you would be so wrong! Jennifer Dukes Lee writes about the many ways we seek approval, and how destructive that need can be. And it isn't always about beauty or personality or even the desire to be loved by friends and family.In Jennifer's case, she writes of a moment in her professional life when she realized she was trying to be a certain kind of person for the benefit of her co-workers. As a reporter for the Des Moines Register, she was sent to vie for a viewing slot for the execution of Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City with a truck bomb.While making her way to the signup sheet for the press lottery, she realized she didn't want to be there; she didn't want this so-called opportunity. ""My feet stopped moving,"" she writes. ""I stood under the late-afternoon sun, near the prison, feeling like another kind of prisoner.""Can anyone relate to wanting to uphold an image in front of your colleagues? I sure could! A newsroom is one of those places you absolutely have to maintain a facade of toughness, if not cynicism. Jennifer also writes about trying to gain approval in the home, at church, in front of other moms, and in many other places and situations where self-judgment and recrimination lurk.Reading Jennifer's book, you'll have a chance to think of where your need for attention, or love, or approval lies. And she urges us to finally let go. ""I want to let people know that they matter to God, they matter to others, and they matter to me,"" she concludes. ""Not because of the size of their jeans, their bank accounts, or their influence, but simply because of the size of their God.""",5.0
5605,This series just keeps surprising me. I adored! Emmy! She was smart and sassy just the way I like 'em. And OH MY Hunter (Liam)...enough said. I loved that this book gave some background of Ems and Hunter before getting into the bones. I was a little afraid it was going to start off where Ruger and Sophie's book left off but NO NEED for worries. This book pushed ALL my buttons! Just enough angst and the &#34;wild&#34; parts leapt off the pages. Although I had preordered this book before publication this author has now become a MUST READ for me! The series just builds and grows by leaps and bounds. Love the continuation and the back story. This book is OFF THE CHARTS! for me!

5606,"Well, that took longer than I thought. I finally finished this book last night, it took me a whole week to read. I did enjoy it but I found it lagged a little in the middle. I would pick it up and get through a few pages before I found myself dozing off. The protagonist Jonathan Blair and the mystery of where the curate, John Maypole went kept me coming back for more (and motivating me to read while sitting up).Blair, mining engineer and cartographer, recently returned to Wigan, England from Africa after an expedition with Bishop Hannay. Wigan is a mining town, owned for the last five hundred years or more by the Hannay family.Blair is an outsider, born in Wigan but raised in America, he found his true home in Africa and is eager to return. Hannay dangles an exploration commission to Africa, like a carrot in front of Blair's nose. When Blair is able to discover the whereabouts of the reverend John Maypole the Bishop will fund Blair's return to Africa.John Maypole was engaged to the Bishop's daughter Charlotte. Surprisingly, Charlotte is cold and uncooperative toward Blair and he uncovers very little about their relationship and where John might have gone.Blair sometimes seems a tireless glutton for punishment but he's endearing for his lack of charm and his wickedly sarcastic wit. 'Charlotte's response to some riposte from Earnshaw was a basilisk stare that would have plunged a normal man into silence, but the member of Parliament maintained a confident air of satisfaction. Which was why politicians were assassinated, Blair thought, because nothing else would faze them.'I wasn't crazy about the romantic portion of the story at first. When the relationship began it felt very separate from everything else that was going on. But I did enjoy the details about mining and the descriptions of the mines, the miners and the dangerous conditions underground. The author describes the landscape both under and above ground vividly, the secondary characters are interesting and sometimes frightening and the ending was very satisfying. I'm glad I stuck with this one and finished.",4.0
5607,"Even if you have never known anyone who suffered from this such horrible abuse, you can related to main character, Christine almost immediately.  When a novel is written so well that readers feel, actually feel the pain and turmoil of those involved, it says so much for the author. Brandi Kennedy made my heart rate accelerate and plunge all on one page.  Expect to cry because there is nothing pretty or funny about this violent subject and this author takes you directly into every emotion felt by a victim.  But most importantly, expect to learn.  I gained respect for Ms. Kennedy for her depth in broaching a sensitive, somewhat taboo, and socially closeted subject.There will be a sequel, but Fighting for Freedom is a stand alone that makes you eager to learn more about the main character.  Where does Christine go and who does she allow into her inner sanctum after such horrible experiences?  Will she attach to Aiden or will he be the one to help guide her further along her path to recovery?Fighting for Freedom is a well-written, inspirational novel that I highly recommend, not just for women who have been abused, but for everyone. It will enlighten you and the more people understand, the more help for battered spouses will increase. Although it's predominately women, men also have violent spouses and it's a mind-blowing experience for them since they are supposed to be the stronger sex.  An almost forbidden subject to write about, but so necessary to help others see the warning signs and get out before something horrific happens.I hope this novel moves more people to volunteer at shelters or at least drop off books and other luxuries to help those who have been abused gain some self esteem.

5611,"MORE THAN FRIENDS, the second novella in Tabetha Thompson's The Friend Zone series picks up with Chloe hospitalized after Todd's attack. Skye is heartbroken he was not able to keep her from danger and has not left the hospital once. He is by her side as much as the hospital will allow.  If I hadn't already fallen for him in the first book, his pure sweetness and love for Chloe in MTF clenched the deal.MTF is more intense than the first novella, dealing straight on with the serious issues of domestic violence and drug addiction.  There are so many twists and surprises as Chloe and Skye's friends try to get to the bottom of the attack and other mysteries.  The strong bonds of true friendship and the devastation of betrayal by a trusted friend along with the other surprises in the story plot kept me riveted and reading this one straight through way past my bedtime.  Ms. Thompson handles it all brilliantly and by using varying POV's writes a well-rounded story very personalized as to what is going through each characters head. Skye is an absolute angel in his love and devotion to Chloe. Sara is an amazing friend to Chloe. Another new bright spot is Sally, Chloe's nurse in ICU.  LOVED her!!  Wise, caring and goes out of her way for Chloe, Skye, Sara and their friends.I don't want to include spoilers and ruin the pleasure of other readers but I will say that in the midst of all the danger, heartache, and betrayal Skye and Chloe's love shines through.

5616,"When I was on a real tear a couple years ago, reading as much short fiction in a summer as I could, this anthology was recommended to me more than a couple of times. Had I not already been swamped with a line-up of collections and anthologies to read at the time, I would have added this one to the pile sooner. Now, having read it, I see that I should have made it a priority.Dark Forces is not only a truly entertaining book from front to back, but serves as a valuable time capsule for its time, having been published in the very early 80s it manages to show how some of the then up-and-comers fared alongside some true legends in the horror genre.Right off the bat, the book gave me the chance to revisit Stephen King's The Mist, which is the very last story and the one I immediately jumped to. I don't often re-read books, but for this gem of a tale I'd make an exception. Honestly, if you haven't read The Mist yet, then do yourself a favor and just go buy this anthology. It'll be worth the pricetag for that one novella alone.Ramsey Campbell's &#34;The Brood&#34; reminded me that I need to pick up one of the novels I have of his sitting on my bookshelf and get to reading his work again. The guy is a wee bit amazing with the tales of terror. Robert Bloch's &#34;The Night Before Christmas&#34; on the other hand was a bit of a letdown, though not because it was poorly written--quite the opposite--but the author of Psycho felt a bit too clever in this one. Then Charles L. Grant's &#34;A Garden of Black  Red Roses&#34; offered a really great glimpse of a guy whose work I need to get to know, as he deftly spins a quiet, smalltown horror story here. Joyce Carol Oates is another writer with a skilled hand at disquieting stories, and &#34;The Bingo Master&#34; manages to do just that, though it's one of the few tales I felt took a good long while in getting warmed up.It's been nearly thirty-five years since Dark Forces originally came out--nearly ten since Cemetery Dance republished it for an anniversary edition here--and there are times while reading that it does feel dated. Not out-dated, mind you, but there is a kind of nostalgic kick that comes with reading some of these stories. Or mayne it's just the brand of new horror that I've been reading with a harder, slightly meaner tone, which has me seeing this book with a rose-colored hue. In any case, I wholly recommend it to horror readers who have yet to give it a try, especially those who maybe have only read recent works lately. It might serve you well to dip into the past for this one.",5.0

As she tries to handle her mother's grief and hold her family together, her plans for the future are also upended. And in walks Josh Walker, her hero.The reason I gave Full Measures 3 stars has to do with the pacing at which the relationship develops between Ember and Josh. Ember's inability to make up her mind was also frustrating, predictable, and far-fetched at times. I'm also still not sure how I feel about Josh's secret since it was also predictable.

5626,"Where has this author been all my life? The Headmistress of Rosemere, despite the chilly setting of the English moors, was just the book I needed to beat the winter blues! Almost everything I love about Regency fiction and the classic novel has been brought to life in this, the second book in the Whispers on the Moors series from author Sarah Ladd. A dangerous hero and of course, the beautiful but embattled estate, makes for an irresistible combination that hooked me from the first page.William Sterling and Patience Creighton are typical romance characters, but I love them! Rogish gentleman and mild-mannered ladies are my absolute favorites to read. William is the typical 'bad boy' -- he gambles, he drinks, and of course he rides a fast horse. He's a regular James Dean, but in a cravat. Patience Creighton, the headmistress at the girl's school on his estate, is loyal, sweet, and dedicated to keeping her late father's dream of a school alive. When they meet again unexpectedly the sparks, as they say, fly! I was a littttle disappointed in the lack of danger and mystery that a lot of my favorite Gothic novels have, but I was far from being bored. The secondary characters didn't really add much to the tale, but William and Patience are such strong leads that I didn't mind as much as I usually do. I just wished that Cassandra didn't have to get her heart broken. *Le sigh.* WIll she get her own story? Fingers crossed!The Headmistress of Rosemere is a fantastic story. Jane Eyre fans will definitely want to check this out. It will be interesting to see what comes in the next story for the ladies of Darbury, England.

Each person goes through a simulation that tests their personality tendencies and strengths, and then suggests which of the five Factions that person should choose. But within that Faction, rules are very clear, and there is limited communication between the Factions. They were designed to promote peace - allowing similar people to live and work together in their strengths and to avoid conflict. But all is not harmonious. Something is wrong in the Factions.When Tris, raised quietly in Abnegation, takes her aptitude test, her results are Divergent...meaning she can fit into multiple Factions.

5632,"First I should say that I admire anyone who has the guts to write & publish a book That said, those same people should learn basic rules of grammar & punctuation before they publish. That's why there are editors & proofreaders. Ms. Belle really can't figure out when to use a comma; there are well over 50 instances of misused commas, mostly inserting them where they don't belong, but also omitting them where they should be, or using them where a semicolon should be. Apostrophes & hyphens also seem to be challenging for her. Perhaps she should check out Grammarly's online services before publishing her next book.  There are times where the syntax is odd, making it difficult to determine what is being said. Also, it's Marine Corps (not Corp), whose (not who's), one's teeth clench (they don't clinch), the past tense of drag is dragged (not drug). My favorite was when sheik was used when she meant chic. That error made me laugh out loud. I could go on & on, but it's too painful.But, even with all the errors mentioned above, the worst part is the writing -- it's just awful & amateurish. I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews before I wasted my time on this drivel. The mere mention of a comparison to 50 Shades of Gray, possibly the worst book I ever tried to read (but couldn't get past 40 or 50 pages), should have warned me. I skipped the gratuitous S&M; scenes & skimmed much of the book. There was much opportunity to give insight into why otherwise intelligent women would allow themselves to be manipulated by a sadist. The only character I could tolerate was Sutton, & he deserves a better book. It's as though 2 authors wrote this mess -- the author who emulated &#34;50 Shades&#34; & someone else with a brain.The book was a free download, so at least I didn't spend money on this, but it wasn't worth the time it took to read. Don't waste your time.",1.0

5637,"This beautiful, beautiful book, a novel with the intimate feel of a novella, opens with a two-stanza poem by Emily Dickinson, ""Ample make this bed."" It closes with a translation of the same poem into Dutch. By the time we reach the end, we have taken possession of the epigraph, fully understanding its relevance to the whole -- and why the protagonist, a youngish Dutch Dickinson scholar named Emilie, needed to translate it into her own language, to take that possession, to make it personal to her. Dickinson's poetic style, deceptively simple diction hiding profound thoughts, is also true of Bakker, whose short chapters and clean declarative sentences pack an insidious emotional heft.If this sounds too airy-fairy, turn to the facts. The setting is NW Wales, a little south of Caernarfon, nestling by the western slope of Snowdon, Wales' highest mountain. The young Dutch scholar has rented an isolated farmhouse at the far end of a mile-long lane. In one of her fields are ten white geese that slowly begin disappearing, prey perhaps to foxes. Flocks of sheep or herds of cows appear in other fields from time to time, though she knows nothing about that. The location and countryside is so precisely described that you can easily locate the area on a map, walk where she walks, and see what she sees, including the shy badgers that for some reason appear to her but are seldom seen by others. The recurrent landscape and animal references are clearly intentional; there is something instinctual in Emilie's escape here also, like an animal going to ground.I must be cautious in describing the human parts of the story, because Bakker is masterly in how he parcels out information. We soon learn that Emilie has come to Wales at short notice from Holland, leaving both her husband and her former job at a university. Her need for solitude in Wales is matched by the combined curiosity and suspicion in the few locals that she meets. Only two people visit her house: one a local sheep farmer whom she immediately sees as an enemy, the other a young man of around twenty called Bradwen. He is as sensitive and caring as the older man is surly, and the blossoming of their relationship (though seldom in obvious ways) is largely responsible for the beauty that suffuses the latter half of the book.In thinking about how to avoid spoilers, I have come to realize one of the most extraordinary aspects of Bakker's novel. It is full of secrets and minor revelations, and yet at the same time it also seems preordained, a natural process that you just wait to be played out. I don't think I have ever before experienced the curious combination of emotions I felt as various forces all come together towards a climax in the last fifty pages of the book: perched on the edge of my chair to learn what would happen next, yet all the time feeling this was right, right, right.Absolutely one of my top books of the year so far. The only thing that might have made it even more enjoyable would have been to read it in the British edition. The book and the excellent translation by David Colmer are the same; the title,THE DETOUR, is less evocative, though closer to the Dutch -- but there is that magnificent cover which is even truer to Bakker's spare elegance.",5.0

I, being a father of two twin boys can certainly relate to some of the issues faced with the persona of this character, albeit not all of them, but still it captured my attain.Words to describe this story are well written, romantic, sexy at times, suspenseful in a dramatic type of way that will keep you engulfed in an amazing way.5 Stars and can&#8217;t wait to get started with book 2 of the series.",5.0

What I liked about this book was that it felt authentic and deeply rooted in facts and recorded history, but adds layer upon layer of intricate storytelling as the life of this notable king is explored. Mr. Culley draws readers back into Hammurabi's life as enemies surface, kingdoms fall, betrayal comes from unexpected places and the pain of life adds wounds to the king's already battered rule. The story is evocative, lush, vivid with imagery, uses strong dialogue to help the story progress and dives deeper into the development of the characters (both historical and original) that bring this tale to life.

5653,"I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.Mara tells the story of a group of teenagers, Unusuals, who&#8217;ve just begun to learn about their powers and abilities. Mara is the main character, and other notable characters are Miyuki, Chris, Alex and Miles. Mara&#8217;s past is riddled with dark mysteries, from how she escaped her home to how she fled away from her brother. She&#8217;s a little on the dark side as far as teenagers go &#8211; she&#8217;s tough, not afraid to fight anyone who stands in her way, but she&#8217;s also quite depressed, and blames herself for a lot of things that happened to her. She hasn&#8217;t had the easiest childhood, and the effects of the abuse follow her today.It was hard to sympathize with Mara at first. I thought she&#8217;d gone through something bad in her childhood, but had no idea was. It was only when it was made clear, that I began to truly feel sorry for her.Mara and her friends each control and element. Mara&#8217;s element is fire. She&#8217;s spent her whole life hiding her abilities, but when the other members of her group tell her they have similar abilities, she begins to realize she&#8217;s not the only one with certain powers. But when a loner is forced to work together, things start to get hectic fast, and Mara has to fight against her own nature and learn to work with others. Especially when some people, led by a mysterious fellow named The Stranger, are out to get them. When her brother returns to town, Mara will have to overcome her fears fast, before he damages her even more than he already has.I mentioned before how hard it was to like Mara at the start, but her bad girl &#8211; attitude grew on me as the book progressed. By the end, I liked her more than all the others. She&#8217;s not afraid in the face of a challenge, and she won&#8217;t go down without a fight, two qualities I like about people. The secondary characters were okay as well. Mara&#8217;s brother was evil, but still very intriguing. The Stranger is still a mystery, and I&#8217;m eager to read more about him and find out who he is. Miyuki was okay, although she did act arrogant at times. Chris and Miles were okay, but they didn&#8217;t leave a lasting impression.Overall, this book was a great read.

5662,"I still have the original 1957 version of this text, which I bought about forty years ago. It had been in storage for God knows how long, and when I received my copy a number of months ago, I put it on my (almost endless) list of books to review.Rereading this text was fun for a few reasons. First, Alan Watts is a superb writer, and now that I'm an author, I enjoyed gleaning ""tips"" from the master's prototypical prose. Ken Wilber confesses that he became an accomplished writer by copying Alan Watts' texts by hand, so I'm not the first writer to seek improvement by studying Watts' words.Second, the text was a felicitous read--concise, lucid prose seasoned with Watts' anti-Procrustean perspectives on Zen and life. In eight chapters--The Philosophy of the Tao, The Origins of Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, The Rise and Development of Zen, ""Empty and Marvelous,"" ""sitting Quietly, Doing Nothing, Za-zen and the Koan, and Zen in the Arts--Watts provides a fine summary of the Background and History of Zen, as well as its Principles and Practice. Moreover, he does so in unsurpassed style.Third, now that I'm an expert (""beginner's mind"" is for the birds) in Eastern philosophy, I had a field day picking out passages that pointed out my differences with Watts. Here are a few of them, followed by my comments in parentheses:""One might as well use `blah' - which is almost exactly what Buddhism does with the nonsense word `tathata.' For the function of these nonsense terms is to draw attention to the fact that logic and meaning, with its inherent duality, is a property of thought and language but not of the actual world.""(First off, ""tathata"" (suchness) is hardly a nonsense word. And if Watts had truly grokked its meaning, he'd have realized that it is equivalent to Divine being-ness, which a yogi experiences when he unites his consciousness (the immanenent, contracted Dharmakaya) with Clear-Light Energy (the Sambhogakaya). Secondly, although logic is a property of thought, it is rooted in the actual world, because it identifies, without contradiction, the facts that pertain to reality.)""If Nirvana is is actually here and now so that to seek it is to lose it, realization through progressive stages is hardly appropriate. One would have to see into into it in the present moment, directly.""(The Buddha himself described the attainment of Nirvana in progressive terms. Because of the multi-sheathed nature of incarnated humans, an individual must undergo a divinization process in real time before he can attain Nirvana, Buddhahood.)""The duality of subject and object, of the knower and the known, is seen to be just as relative, as mutual, as inseparable as every other. We do not sweat because it is hot; the sweating is the heat.""(I don't know about you, but even though I may sweat because of the heat, it is clear to me that my sweat and the heat are distinct from each other. And sometimes I don't sweat when it is hot.)""To put it another way, it becomes vividly clear that in concrete fact I have no other self than the totality of things of which I am aware.""(We are not aware of things about ourselves that others are. Hence, one's self exceeds one's awareness. Furthermore, one's self also includes one's body.)The most negative aspect of this text is Watts' disrespect for meditation, sometimes referred to as ""za-zen"" (or ""sitting"") in Zen parlance. He writes:""Although the name Zen is `dhyana,' or meditation, other schools of Buddhism emphasize meditation as much as, if not more than, Zen--and at times it seems as if the practice of formal meditation were not necessary to Zen at all... Yet however  much za-zen may have been exaggerated in the Far East, a certain amount of ""sitting just sit"" might well be the best thing in the world for jittery minds and agitated bodies of Europeans and Americans--provided they do not use it as a method for turning themselves into Buddhas.""(In direct contradistinction to Watts, I say that meditation is a sine qua non if one wants to attain Buddhahood. Watts' dissing of meditation fostered the spread of Beat, or pop, Zen, and the result has been an endless proliferation of Maynard G. Krebs-type ""Zen masters."")Speaking of ""Zen masters,"" the way Watts describes them, one has to wonder if he ever encountered a true Zen master. Watts writes:""Zen masters are quite human. They get sick and die; they know joy and sorrow; they have bad tempers or other little `weaknesses' of character just like anyone else, and they are not above falling in love and entering into a fully human relationship with the opposite sex. The perfection of Zen is to be perfectly and simply human.""Given the fact that Watts personally knew many ""Zen masters,"" and knew that none of them was truly En-Light-ened, it's not surprising that when he encountered the teachings of Franklin Jones (a.k.a. Bubba Free John, Da Free John, and, finally Adi Da) fifteen years after he wrote ""The Way of Zen,"" he declared, ""I have been waiting for an Avatar all my life, and now he has come.""I spent years studying and practicing Zen, and like Watts, when I read Adi Da, I realized the limitations of Zen. Zen is to Dzogchen what Advaita Vedanta is to Kashmir Shaivism--its poor sister. Nevertheless, Zen is still worth studying and practicing, and Watts' book, despite its limitations, is an amenable introduction to the subject.",4.0

5673,"I absolutely enjoyed Lord Somerton's Heir. In this romantic mystery, Sebastian Alder survived Waterloo, barely. As he recovers, a woman appears to inform him that now, he is Lord Somerton. Removed to better chambers and an increased hope of actual recovery, he finds the legacy a great deal more trouble than it seemed to be worth.""The Somerton inheritance was a tainted privilege. In some ways he was no better off than he would have been if he had remained a penniless officer of the line on half pay. At least then he only had his siblings and himself to worry about. Now he had a household and an estate, all claiming pennies from a purse that looked decidedly the worse for wear.... Where had it all gone and how, in God's name, was he expected to restore the family fortunes?He had thought the matter through in the tedious hours in the coach and decided that if he thought of the task ahead as being akin to a sudden promotion to Colonel of a regiment, it did not seem so daunting.""Sebastian meets the new family, assumes his new responsibility and intends to make provisions for his brother and sister. As soon as he untangles the financial mess Anthony Kingsley left behind. There are hanger's on, wise granny, an aunt and dozens of cousins, plus tenants, retainers and servants to assess and get to know. Always near by, ready to offer assistance or subtle guidance, is Isabel. He sees her wounds, the grief she struggles beneath and that she is trying to reach beyond the sorrows and anger. Through Sebastian's eyes we observe Isabel's healing steps, stumbles and set backs. It was an interesting perspective because generally the socks are on the other foot.This story is slightly Gothic in tone, the writing smooth and gently reflective. There was an old-fashioned pace I really enjoyed. There was no rush of the romance, the story or the ending. The dialog kept you in the period without effort or cliches. Characters were believable, though slowly revealed. Personally I like that but others may find the bits and pieces revelation too old skool. Secondary characters weren't two dimensional though the villains were both over the top once their disguises were stripped away. I was disappointed by the second villain's big reveal. For all the realism it brought to the story, I felt manipulated and a wee bit resentful.I liked Sebastian, his siblings and Isabel. I appreciated how the tragic past was handled as part of the story, not a cudgel to wallow in and create more angst. They were the Ordinary Folks we all think we are until trials come our way and we learn not only is there more to us, but less as well. Confronting their own failings, they have compassion for other's. Mostly, it was absolutely wonderful to read an Awakening Story that wasn't all about the sexual attraction or trumped up conflicts that reduce hero and heroine to argumentative banter based on misunderstandings. They were cautious with each other, kind to themselves even. Taking time, giving support and space as needed, Sebastian and Isabel's story advanced even as the mysteries, debts and confusions mounted to a larger pile.I had a bit of difficulty with the last couple chapters of this book. It tied up ""too neatly"" for me. I like a bit of conflict left hanging, things to work through together in happily ever after land. In fairness, the financial situation is probably Huge Enough, not to mention the ""secret"" Sebastian has chosen to keep. I believe that will come back to bite them both in the end. Of course, it could simply be the fact I seldom like epilogues and this one was a bit too sweet for me. That said, I did enjoy 98.7% of the book, the writing style, characterizations, and well-handles story line. Definitely will look for other works by this author. I recommend Lord Somerton's Heir for when you're in a Traditional mood, looking for a meatier story with a gentle romance.~Note I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I have read (AND enjoyed) other books that ended on a cliffy. But when you couple the ending with the other issues I had, this was a book I would say I liked but didn't love.But before you get to the end, there is a whole book to get through. The synopsis for this book is very vague. You basically go into the story blind, having no clue who or what the story is about. When you begin reading, you meet a girl named Amara. She is an Iranian girl growing up in New York. Her family appears to be wealthy but as we all know, looks can be deceiving. No one knows of her father's gambling addiction and the burden it had placed on the family, especially Amara.And thus begins Amara's journey and the lengths she is willing to go to, to save her family. This is also where I became confused a few times during the storyline. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but there does seem to be some inconsistencies in the plot. An example, Amara at one point states she tells her mother everything about what is happening, but then a few chapters later it almost seems like her mother has no clue. And I was also confused by Amara's acceptance of her fate. It seemed a bit odd on how well she adjusted to things.Though I didn't love the book and did have some issues with the storyline, I did find it intriguing and it held my attention for the most part. There were times that I did find myself skimming pages as things seemed to drag a bit. And I am not sure what it was but I never felt connected with the characters. While that is not important for some, it is for me. I want to feel the emotions the characters are feeling. And when I don't, it tends to affect my overall experience.Not my favorite from this author by a long shot, but still interesting enough that I find myself invested enough to pick up the second book when it releases.",3.0

The plot moves along swiftly and carries you with it so easily that hours might pass before you are aware that you live in a different reality.  Now, I am going to buy the second in the trilogy.Excellent read!!!",5.0
5685,This is a story that you will remember because of L K Hill's skillful depiction of a very scary environment full of threats and death.

5686,"I bought this one because it was set in Maine in a coastal village no less, which is always a nice place to visit in a book.  This story was more about the 4 central characters, who are not from Maine,  than the local characters. Only one fisherman figured in the story and then only casually. So essentially, this story could happen anywhere.  That being said, it was a good read as some characters try to help others and some are too miserable to help anyone else, much less themselves.  An interesting look at the power of empathy to bring change.",4.0

5691,"I received an advance reader's copy of this book to try out, and I have to say that it wasn't bad at all. From the acknowledgements section at the back of the book, I learned that this is author Peggy Eddleman's first novel. For a first outing, I have to say that she did a pretty good job. It wasn't exactly what I expected it to be, but it was decent, nonetheless.This book is set in a post-apocalyptic America that has been devastated by global war. In this imagined future world, highly advanced and destructive &#34;Green Bombs&#34; have killed most of the human population and flattened cities, while still leaving the world green and fertile. While the science behind such a weapon is never really delved into (and, really - it doesn't have to be explained to enjoy the book), it is a neat sort of idea. These bombs have dramatically changed the environment on earth. Electronics have been rendered useless, metal is now brittle, and the atmosphere of the earth now has a layer of &#34;bomb's breath&#34; encircling it. This thin layer of gas is super dense and highly poisonous. One breath of it will kill a person or animal!Small cities have formed and freely trade and communicate with one another, but there are roaming bands of outlaws who would rather steal from others than work for themselves. One such band of thieves attack the town that is the home of the young girl who is the main character, and this leads to the primary conflict in the book. Don't worry, though. The author sees to it that the violence is kept to a minimum, while guiding the heroine of the story through a great adventure.This book has very few flaws. There were a couple of slow chapters and I found myself a bit frustrated by the encumbrance on the main characters that was forced onto them by bringing along a small child on their adventure, but I got past it. I was particularly impressed with the triumphant end to the book. It also seems that the author leaves the door open for more adventures in her newly-created world. The book is intended for a middle school or teen audience, and I think it fits this niche very well. I would not have any problem recommending teachers to include this book on their shelves.",4.0

5693,"After having seen The Lord of the Rings film trilogy recently, I finally got the extra time to read the novel (50th anniversary). Let me just say, to anyone who is reluctant about reading The Lord of the Rings for whatever reason, I beg you to reconsider!! I do not want to bore everywhere with yet anther review of fantasy's most epic novel, nor do I want to spoil the novel for anyone, so in the most basic way possible I will tell you what the novel is about. The Lord of the Rings is a novel that tells the tale of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire who volunteers to take the One Ring of power (which corrupts and destroys whomever comes to possess it), which was forged by the dark lord Sauron, to Mount Doom (where the One Ring was created) and destroy it. That is the basic premise of The Lord of the Rings, but once you begin reading the book, there is so much more to the story than you would ever imagine. The land of Middle Earth is the setting of this tale, and within a few chapters I was fully convinced that Middle Earth was a real place from the past (and I still am to some extent), and that speaks to the creative mind of the author J.R.R. Tolkien.I also highly recommend that if you choose to buy The Lord of the Rings, that you buy the 50th anniversary edition. Basically all of the errors from the various older editions of The Lord of the Rings have been corrected, there are almost 100 pages of amazing appendices at the back (which give you tons of bonus information, from ancient Middle Earth history, chronology, family trees, languages and more) as well as 7 maps (trust me, these are extremely helpful when you are following the various characters journeys).The Lord of the Rings is such a hard novel to review. Those who haven't read it may think it is just another fantasy novel not worth the effort (and time, it is a 1000 page novel) to read. While those who have read it know that once you get to the end, you wish there was more to read, and find it hard to explain the magic of The Lord of the Rings to others. I can only hope that something in my review sparks your interest, and that someday you journey to the Shire, Lothl&oacute;rien, Rivendell and even Mordor. You are at the entrance to the hobbit hole right now, open the door and go inside...",5.0

I assume that it was written to tie a bow on the Damien and Nikki story and introduce us to Evan Black.  As with all of the Stark series, there are struggles and some drama.  Nikki has to confront her past-again, and find the strength to let it go.  Damien is fierce about his woman and is there to help her in any way that he can, and we do mean any way.  This seems to be the steamy emotionally charged conclusion to Nikki and Damien. I love their story and I am a little sad that this may be the end.",4.0
5706,"I have a confession to make.  Sometime in the past 10 years or so, I've fallen away from the world of Shannara.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, don't get me wrong.  Life simply got in the way and other things took over the time I generally gave to reading and Shannara was one of the things that suffered.I miss the world and the time I got to know these characters.  I fell off sometime during the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara and keep meaning to find my way back, but the books are starting to get way ahead of me at this point.  So, before I try to sink my teeth back into the main storyline and try to play catch up, I stumbled across these three short stories and figured that was as good a jumping on point as any.Going in, I have to realize these are short stories.  The epic scope I've come to expect from the series is simply not present, but I'm okay with that.  This is my chance to spend a little time with characters I've missed.  And I've missed good old grumpy Allanon.It's been years since I've read The Sword of Shannara, but I was happy to see an account of events that lead up to that book.  Allanon is searching for a surviving member of the Shannara line, any member will do, and he's at the end of his desperation.  All seems to be lost, but there is one more thread to check out before he's ready to concede failure.I think it's admirable what Brooks is able to pull off in so few pages.  We get a little time with Allanon as he fears he may have let his guard down and failed in a huge way and his desperate attempt to fix it.  There's a nice little twist or two thrown in to keep us and Allanon on our feet.  These aren't pages filled with action, but when it does hit, it's good stuff.It was a nice little slice of Shannara life and I felt it was definitely worth the 99 cents and tax I threw down to experience it.  It put me back in a Shannara frame of mind, and I'm okay with that.",4.0

I fell in love with this story and with Blackjack in chapter one.  I still can&#8217;t put my finger on what it was that made me just ADORE this couple and their story, I wish I could but trust me, it is one of my favorite books EVER.This isn&#8217;t a love story with tons of hot sex; this is a real story of love.  Jack knows he has fallen in love the first second he sees Elise in his court room.  Being a new judge he is bound by the ethics of the system and has to make a decision and declaration right then.  This knocks Elise off her feet and the story begins.  Where Jack is used to getting what he wants, he has come to feel the obligation to earn what he has beginning as a teenager.  This is where he is going to struggle with Elise, he wants her but he feels he needs to earn her love and trust.Elise had a messed up childhood, most of the early years she can&#8217;t remember.  Although she is a forceful and successful attorney now, she has mother issues and fears of people leaving her so trusting Jack the sexy playboy judge is never going to happen.  When a crisis happens in her life she is forced to look at her past head on and figure out what it is she is most afraid of.I just LOVE the way these two interact with each other.  I am so in love with Jack it isn&#8217;t even funny.  Yes he has been pushed to my top three fictional boyfriends.  At times I wanted to be angry at Elise for keeping Jack at a distance but the author did such a fantastic job at showing us the true woman and broken child inside of Elise I couldn&#8217;t be angry at her.  Jack is just the gentleman that all women swoon over even though the media cast him in a playboy light; he is so far from that it is crazy.This was one of those books I couldn&#8217;t put down, even when I was forced to do the daily chores of life or try to sleep; I found my mind going back to those two.  They are seriously people I wish I had in my real life they were just so perfect, even with their fears and flaws; they would make the real world a much better place.  I will certainly be following this author and grabbing her next book.

If the disease doesn&#8217;t loosen its grip, it won&#8217;t be long before it sucks me down. I&#8217;m scared to death, and sad,&#8221; Regine writes in her blog-adapted book, &#34;Regine&#8217;s Book &#8211; A Teen Girl&#8217;s Last Words.&#34;At three hundred and thirty-six glossy pages, this paperback targets those who loved the girl behind her worldwide blog about her illness, those facing the daunting disease of leukemia, or those curious about dying at a young age. With minor profanity and topics discussing effects of medications, medical issues, and death, it would be geared toward mature readers. Many colored photographs of the beautiful girl, her family, and friends, along with her artistic creations and poems grace the pages.When seventeen year old Regine Stokke in Norway heard she had a lethal form of leukemia, she did her best to overcome it. Going through numerous painful bone marrow biopsies, intense chemotherapies, a bone marrow transplant, over four Vidaza cycles, and three bouts of blood poisoning, she fought back with determination, only to succumb to the horrible disease fifteen months later.Blogging as often as her worn down body could handle, she had over nine thousand internet followers, who sometimes posted up to seventeen hundred responses. Her book adds others&#8217; posts of encouragement, love, and hope as well as a few insensitive, hurtful comments with her responses.Reflecting on her young life of family, friends, and school, her posts reflect both positive and negative mood swings as she deals with each stage of the invasive cancer. Lonely, broken, and crying, the writer pours out her soul in short poems, art work, and written notes.Throughout the writing, types of leukemia are explained, along with several medical treatments. The young teenager promotes others to become blood or bone marrow donors, but there are no resources listed at the end of the book.Rallying or relapsing, she fights to experience life as a normal teen by going to rock concerts, flying in a helicopter, or taking short trips. Toward the end of life, she accepts the reality of death, as sad and heart-breaking as it is.Mentioning more than once, Regine had no faith in God or belief in an afterlife. One hopes this young, brave girl found the Peace that passes all understanding before she met her Maker or that others, because of her book, seek Him for redemption.Zest Books LLC furnished a complimentary book in exchange for a review of the reader&#8217;s honest opinion.",4.0

Once she found that book though &#8211; it was downhill for me. I just didn't like her, thought she behaved awfully, appallingly &#8211; to her would be boyfriends, to her friends, even her family. She came across as selfish, obsessed with proving the book right regardless of how much hurt she could cause, and it turned her from a loving person and a good friend into someone I really disliked.

Great story-line--Great love story.The only thing that was slightly irritating was just when I was riveted to the story, the author would throw in details of their dress or describe their surroundings breaking the train of thought. Her descriptions were not well placed. But other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the story and characters.  To be able to write something unique, with so many Historical Romance books on the market, is quite a feat. Denise Domning is a very talented author with a wonderful imagination. I look forward to reading more from her.""Almost Perfect"" was well worth the price of the boxed set.I just finished reading the second book ""Honor's Players"" by Holly Newman, also a new author for me.I was able to finished it, but it was a very STRANGE book. Viscount St. Ryne was concidered a great catch on the Marriage Market, being rich and handsome, but he did not want any of the insipid debutantes his mother kept throwing at him. When he visited his club, wagers were being made as to the unlikelihood of Elizabeth Monweithe ""the Shrew"" ever finding a husband, so St. Ryne bet against the odds, that she would marry, and sight unseen decided to marry her himself. Later he saw her at a ball and she was beautiful, but she told him off and tried to throw punch in his face. He married her, playing out Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"". He playing the role of Petruchio, and pretended Elizabeth was Katharina, the Shrew...and he set out to tame her, following the example of Petruchio  by treated her abominably. It was not realistic unless Viscount St. Ryne was mad, and he was portrayed to be mad. I liked Elizabeth, and felt sorry for her. I would probably give it a 3 Star rating. It certainly was a unique book.Now to read the 3rd and final book of the trilogy: ""Roses at Midnight"" by another author unknown to me, Diane A. S. Stuckart.",5.0

5732,"This book was written in 1940 if memory serves. It tells the story of the rise of a Pan Asiatic power combining the creativity of Japan, the brawn of China and the brains of India. And America defeated and in ruins, occupied and enslaved. And out of the ashes America rises to retake her birthright. Sounds like any number of novels and B-movies today but this was one of the first, written by a true master of his craft. The same author who brought us &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; brings us &#34;The Lord Mota&#34;, note it's the word &#34;atom&#34; spelled backwards......long before the general public was aware of our atom bomb research.",5.0

Big sister does what she can which includes basically prostituting herself and then goes missing. The next oldest sister tries to find her  while taking care of the younger brother.

5735,"The first book in the Heat Series is an action packed futuristic romance with a sexy visitor from another universe.Hiding from her countless fans on her private asteroid in Earth&#8217;s orbit, Shara Weston life is interrupted when a captivating alien crash lands on her asteroid. Cade Archer is on a mission to free his people from cruel enslavement by opening a portal from his planet to Earth. But a powerful enemy has followed hell bent on stopping him and sends Shara and Cade on the run. Shara has misgivings about Cade&#8217;s mission, but as they embark on Cade&#8217;s quest, the passion between them explodes.This fast paced plot takes the reader on fantastic futuristic tale that keeps the reader on their toes as the danger escalates and the passion erupts.  The author brings the story to life with vivid imagery, suspense and strong enchanting characters that grab the reader&#8217;s attention and doesn&#8217;t let go.The chemistry between the Shara and Cade is out of this world hot and the well written sex scenes are hot and steamy and sexy alien powers adds in some sizzling spice.  The author conveys all the emotions, passion and personalities of all the characters with intensity and ensures that the reader can easily relate to them and understand the motivations behind their actions.The author has created a wonderful futuristic earth that captures the reader&#8217;s imagination and has not only great main characters but supporting characters as well. The mind boggles at some of the possibilities at where the author can take this series.I found that I really enjoyed this book and I can&#8217;t wait to read the next one in the series.  I really enjoyed that the author not only brought aliens to earth she set the story way into Earth&#8217;s future, but doesn&#8217;t make things so out of the realm of possibility that the reader gets too caught up trying to figure out what&#8217;s what. I also like that the hero and heroine both had complex personalities that kept me guessing just what they might do next.",4.0
5736,"This book is tricky mostly because she interchanges her pattern pieces, aka one yoke will be used on multiple designs, as well as sleeves. This means that all the same pattern pieces for one garment are not in the same place. It was a serious treasure hunt trying to find all the pieces, and the instructions were rather negligible, but I'm used to that with sewing magazines. I used my own techniques anyway.Personally, I love not having seam allowances. That way I can measure the garment and get an idea how it compares to my child's measurements. Also, I like to have various seam allowances where I want them. I just eye it, and that's been fine for me.The dress I made, the little  ruffle cap sleeve one was so adorable on my two year old. I have never made anything so universally admired, but that may have been the cupcake fabric I used. I fully lined the top, and the caps, so I didn't use the instructions. It was admittedly a pain in the pattern stages, but the final results well worth the effort.",4.0
5737,"I enjoyed this story by Stella Cameron, however, sometimes the storyline was a bit erratic.  I know it was to add mystery to the three brothers an other characters in the murder mystery but it did not flow as smoothly as it could have.  Nevertheless it's a good enough storyline to read.",4.0

5739,"The beginning of this book reminded me somewhat of Sophie Kinsella's &#34;Do You Want to Know a Secret&#34; in that it begins with a flight on an airline.  Therein ends the similarity.As someone who is not exactly a size 2, much of this book was offensive, despite its frequently humorous occurrences.  Holly is an overweight, out of shape young widow who encounters personal trainer Logan Montgomery on a flight.  Logan is so full of himself that he's not very likeable at all, nor are his friends, who I found to be superfluous characters who held back, as opposed to moved the story along.  Based on this paragraph, you'd think this would have been a one-star rating.Yet, despite all those downsides, the book is frequently amusing, and you'll find yourself rooting for Holly.  It's a good summer read, no more, no less.",3.0
5740,"I received this book as an e-book free to review from Netgalley.  I would love to have a paper copy of it because - well, I prefer hard copies of cookbooks and it is so beautiful and useful.  The book has recipes arranged by seasons and is beautifully adorned with photographs of vegetables growing in gardens, freshly picked, and cooked in recipes.  On the bottom of each recipe page is an area to write your own notes.  The recipes are often unique - like fried lemons and bacon popped popcorn, contain lots of butter and heavy cream and have good cooking tips.  I learned that you can put lettuce in soup, and that if you soak potato wedges in ice water for 30 minutes before baking them, they come out crispy without being deep fried.  I would have liked to see more photographs of the actual recipes themselves because I could not figure out how the summer squash lasagna rolls would work - does squash hang out the ends? I think this is a lovely cookbook that contains delicious recipes and I highly recommend it.",5.0

5749,"Her Perfect Mate is Paige Tyler's first book in her X-Op series.  This book is a full length story...just thought I would mention it because most of Paige's published stories are novella's. This one took me a couple of hours to read...if not more cause there is a lot of detail in this book so I might of had to reread a couple of paragraphs just to make sure I understood the military terminology. I was pretty amazed by all the detail in the story. The book is cross between a action-adventure, romantic paranormal, and government agent thriller.In Her Perfect Mate, government agent Ivy Halliwell is paired with Special Forces agent Landon Donovan. Landon is not thrilled to be pulled from his current assignment but he gives the new partnership a chance.  Ivy is a &#34;shifter&#34; but in Paige Tyler's new X-Ops world, shifters don't shift into animals..they just share animal characteristics like better eyesight, hearing, etc.  I liked this new concept, found it unique and enjoyable.

5768,"I picked up this book because I love the Oxford English Dictionary, and lexicography in general. The story itself is fascinating, but Winchester's telling does it a great disservice, in large part because he spends far more time than necessary on numerous parts of the story. I came away from this with the sense that there just wasn't enough for a book (despite the fact that this is a very short book and its font and size suggest a young-adult audience). Winchester apparently doesn't have the talent to turn what is an amazing story into an enjoyable book. One further annoyance: he refers on occasion to pictures, but there are no photos in the book. There are drawings scattered throughout the book, but they are unlabeled and serve no real person. The decisions about illustration just reinforce the sense that this is a shoddily conceived product.",1.0

5771,"The first thing I'd like to say about Fallen From Grace by Leigh Songstad is that it's one of those books that once I started to read it, I didn't want to put down, but I had to sleep at some time. Having started it the night before, I finished it the very next day. I think what drew me in the most was the fact I thought the two main characters &#8211; Judas and Grace, had amazing chemistry together. There were times when I could feel their frustrations when they had outside pressures on both of them. As a reader, I felt a lot of empathy towards them as the story unfolded and I learned more about what had happened in their pasts and the pressures they felt from family or others. I also liked the fact that as far as a career, Grace was a highly regarded psychologist. As far as secondary characters, there's one character that definitely stood out, and that's Senator Ellis. There were several times throughout the book that I wanted to slap him just because of things he said and actions he took.Overall, Fallen From Grace was a book that flowed easily, and I thought the pacing was just right. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who likes contemporary romance.",5.0

Now that Jaime&#8217;s put her life on hold and delayed college, she&#8217;s two years behind with nothing to show for it. Loser ex!! With the summer off and no plans until she starts college and a new job in the fall, Jaime travels from Boston to Ireland determined to have a good time.  Things are looking up when the gorgeous Irish barman, Connor serves her a Guinness at the local pub. Yet, what Jaime thought of as a vacation fling turns into something so much more. Connor has found a place in her heart and settled in deep.Connor works at the family&#8217;s pub saving every dime to go back to college for his engineering degree.  He&#8217;s wasted years on a misspent youth and plans on correcting that in the fall.

Even though Jaime and Connor&#8217;s relationship happens in ten days it didn&#8217;t feel like insta-love to me at all. They used every free minute getting to know each other.

Of course he&#8217;d want that&#8212;to mess around and discover how she worked, how to make her respond.Oh my, and yes, please!!This was HOT!

I loved the storyline, and such a sweet ending and Jake was the typical, perfect K.A. male.  I have to wonder, though, why does K.A. seem to think that anyone over the age of 38 (in her books) is too old to have children?  Just wondering.  It would not seem to be so in real life - at least with my friends.  At least this K.A. book is better than Jagged - but almost anything would have to be.  Still annoyed over that one!",3.0

When I started reading there were two reviews one liked it and one didn't and at that point I was undecided, before I continued I re-checked the reviews to find Serena's which described exactly what I was feeling, the beginning of the book is confusing and difficult to get into and I agree it should be re-done because some people won't get past this which would be a shame since the rest of it is really good. A great story with fantastic characters although I do agree with loumar where Mia is concerned the way she speaks particularly early on it's almost like she's in a Victorian novel but I'll definitely be reading the next one since I can't wait to find out what happens next. I'm hoping some of the males find their mates and that Dante and Hailey finally get it together and also Lea, please more on Lea she's wonderful.I've given 4 stars partly because the beginning was not very good, it needed editing and also I assume it was intentional but the identity of Mia's stalker is given away very early on and I personally would have preferred not to know quite so soon.",4.0

5789,"I love this series.  I watch the 30 Life Principle series on InTouch.org, have the Life Principle Bible, Charles Stanley's Handbook for Christian Living, & books from The In Touch Series concerning each principle in greater detail.This book is a study guide that requires Bible reading with Q & A throuout this book.  I like this better than passive reading because many thought provoking questions are asked which challenges your faith to grow.  You see examples of Bible characters & how they responded to God's call & how God empowered them to do His will to do great & marvelous things if they would obey. God still works today in the lives of believers just as He did in the Bible days.  The book moves me & makes me feel as eager to serve God as when I was a new Christian.Each chapter may only be a few pages long, but the book is an excellent educational tool. More importantly the book is also life changing for the Christian.Since I have begun working on completion of this book, I have found it very useful to incorporate the use of the Believer's Bible Commentary by William MacDonald which is useful to give background information to specific passages as well as the meaning of certain passages.  Sometimes this commentary specifically answers the question leaving no doubt as to its meaning.  I like an indepth study.",5.0

5796,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in the JET series.  The author, Russell Blake, stated that originally he intended it to be just a three book series, but that they were so popular he decided to keep writing them.Sadly, I think that was the wrong decision.  The first three books were well crafted.  The plots were fast paced and there wasn't any superfluous text to bog down the stories.  Each book was a page turner and difficult to put down.This is not the case in JET IV.  The action slows waaaaay down and the reader is subjected to unnecessary and frankly boring chunks of text.  I actually found myself skimming through a lot of this book wondering what happened to the break neck action of the first three.Finally, this book steps dangerously close to 'silly romantic' territory.  Formerly, the fact that Jet always seemed to have some man involved in her adventures and had to do the obligatory inner musing about a possible romance annoyed me, but at least she held her own.  In this one, a ridiculous amount of time is spent concentrating on the 'what ifs' of possible romances.  I find it hard to believe that a woman who is literally fighting for her life and the life of her child, has the time to moon around over a guy like a 14 year old girl.The author seems to have forgotten that the timeline for the JET series is extremely truncated.  By my calculations, from the beginning of the first JET book to this one, only about 4 months have passed.However, during one point in this book, while in the midst of a sexual encounter, we find Jet thinking that it had, ""....been so long since she'd had this kind of experience.""  Really?  She hadn't had sex in like 4 months, during which time she was pretty busy with staying alive, but she's inwardly bemoaning her 'celibate' state?It is silly stuff like that, along with the dropping of the action ball, that has me disappointed in this series.After reading this book I read some of the reviews for the next couple and see that some people have cited the same problem: way too much unnecessary detail and little action.Sadly, I think I'm done with this series.  There are so many books out there.  Time is too short to waste on sub par stories.",3.0

5806,"Enormous in scope, action, characters and plot, David J. Bain&#8217;s adventure saga, &#8220;Torn Blood&#8221; may be the most ambitious, well-researched and enthralling novel ever written about the long-standing battle between the Palestinians and the Jews. Bain, who has collaborated on two previous film scripts, succeeds in this debut novel by delivering a Tom Clancy-like thriller with as much insight into the conflict over Israel as you&#8217;ll find in any non-fiction account.  &#8220;Torn Blood&#8221; oozes with fast-paced action and colorful, complex characters, each of them caught up in the seemingly never-ending fight for sovereignty over that tiny piece of land in the heart of the Middle East. Remarkably and essentially, Bain never takes sides in this conflict and he provides the reader with the results of his seven years of research: a detailed historical background which explains the significance of Israel as a Jewish homeland and the seeds of dissension and extremism among Palestinians who believe this same land is rightfully theirs. Meanwhile, &#8220;Torn Blood&#8221; imagines a full-scale campaign to wipe all Jews off the face of the Earth.At the start of &#8220;Torn Blood,&#8221; a diabolical scientist in Northern Kazakhstan explains in a terrifyingly casual way to a group of like-minded Jihadists exactly why and how the chemical weapon Anthrax is the most reliable and effective way to kill the Jews.  Throughout the next 500-plus pages and countless characters and plot lines we see the escalation of this threat contrasted by the strength of spirit and resolve of individuals on both sides of the fight.  Central to the story is a nave, but potentially heroic new recruit to the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv, Addison Deverell. It is through Deverell&#8217;s eyes that we experience much of the action, as he slowly finds himself at the center of the struggle.Every page of this fast-paced, detailed novel explodes with new information, tense negotiations, and potential catastrophe.  While Addison Deverell watches the conflict escalate in the Middle East, another character, Dr. Janelle Henning is half a world away in Oregon when she is contacted by a messenger, drawing her into this tale. Throughout &#8220;Torn Blood,&#8221; the locales are constantly changing, maintaining high, heart-pounding suspense.  Bain spent seven years working with researchers before beginning this novel and it shows. He mixes facts and essential history into the suspense and along the way we are enlightened to the history of the conflict, while meanwhile the action has us on the edge of our seat.It is through our understanding of the history and the Bain&#8217;s believable imagining of the apocalyptic possibilities for the future that we find ourselves deeply drawn into the action with a fresh, educated and entertaining look at a very old conflict between two stubborn and unrelenting rivals. Bain&#8217;s should be applauded for the incredible research that results in a gripping adventure story and an attempt to explain a vital conflict with everything to lose.",5.0

5810,"Here is a book derived from MIT Media Lab research, with the usual overstatement and overimportance that goes along with most Media Lab stuff.  Because this is a popular book, the claims are probably less qualified and hedged than they would be if presented in research papers.  The pre-release copy I read did not include the many figures, which may have made the results look more specific and convincing.The book is based on study of patterns of information exchange (i.e contacts and memes).  The kajillions of bits of data thrown off by Internet users and handheld device users offer lots of opportunities for research.  And, to be fair, Pentland includes an appendix that discusses the dangers inherent in Big Data of this type.So what are the results?  I had a very hard time putting my finger on them.  What good does it do to understand how ideas flow in groups, cities, or the workplace?  Pentland and his students claim that it does some good, and give some interesting anecdotal examples of idea flow and influence.  They tell us that the most successul leaders draw people into a connected team that shares ideas.This last is not news.  Which is the problem I had with the book.  It is full of examples that are immediately stapled to high flown ideas that they may or may not support.  Perhaps this book is the foundation of a new science, or a new field of sociology.  Or perhaps it is just inspiration to researchers along with some reassurance about how Big Data will help rather than hurt us.  Or perhaps I missed the point.",3.0

5815,"Well the book started off great. The heroine was decidedly eccentric and her antics left me chuckling. However after ""falling in love"" she became a ginormous watering pot. Every second dashing away into the glen to weep her eyes out. It really interrupted my enjoyment of the book. Must love be so painful? It was especially worse because her character was so happy before all the love business.Also it came across that the root of all these teary nights was presumption. I have never come across two people assume the worst and blame themselves for all manner of slights. Now that I think about it, that is rather narcissistic of them. That also relates to Ransom not telling you-know-who that he was you-know-what (I never got over that). I felt like shaking both of them and yelling ""It is not always about you!"".Nevertheless the book managed to be enthralling. I sat in bed all Sunday afternoon to finish it.

5817,"As a retired high school English teacher, I was very interested in what Mr. Moore had to say about Common Core. I am not a fan of the new standards (although in my home state of Indiana it's been rejected), but I was curious about Mr. Moore's perspective. The book was very engaging, although some of his personal opinions turned me off. However, we are in complete agreement about the damage being done to public education in order to teach to the test. He spends a great deal of time breaking down the Prentice Hall literature book for juniors, and many of his points hit home because I used that same textbook my last year of teaching in 2012. Even with that silly book, the administration in the large, urban school district where I worked frowned upon its use, preferring that we stick to the script provided by The Springboard series (see CollegeBoard), which had NO literature or even any reference to any; barring that, our students were to work online in a very elementary (and expensive) computer program with nothing but informational text. I was devastated to be told that I could not teach &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; to my eleventh graders because it was too hard, and instead was to teach a unit out of Springboard on global warming, a subject I know little about and which would be better covered in a science class.On the rare occasion that I slipped in some actual literature that year, my students were attentive and engaged. As Moore states, silly art projects dominated instruction, and my job and evaluation depended upon how well I taught these 'subjects'. Having read this book, I am now sure that my students could have risen to the occasion of a Gatsby or Scarlet Letter, but weren't given the chance.I have two family members who are college professors. According to them, all these informational texts that are being force-fed to public school children are NOT making them college ready. In a college class they are expected to have a working knowledge of Shakespeare, or 1984, or the Civil War, and when these young adults stare blankly at the professor because they have not been taught any of this, the instructors are of course angry at the public high schools for not preparing kids for real college.I would recommend this book to educators and parents alike, but I would have preferred Moore's opinions be kept out of it. The facts speak for themselves.",4.0

5830,"When We Met introduced a new group of young, single guys and girls to Fools Gold.  Taryn has moved her PR firm to Fools Gold, at the request of her 3 &#34;boys&#34;.  While she was scouting the town last fall, she caught the eye of &#34;Angel&#34;, who we knew from previous books that had him working at the &#34;bodyguard school&#34;.  Angel &#34;decided&#34; that Taryn was going to be his conquest, and early in this book, he &#34;informed&#34; her.  Taryn was a strong female and needed an equally strong personality in her relationships - she got that with Angel.  But their dynamic seemed so &#34;stilted&#34; and &#34;unnatural&#34;.  I didn't get the butterflies in my stomach as the romance developed, like I have in previous books.  Angel and Taryn both have baggage - I felt that Angel's baggage was sufficiently explained and dealt with in this book, but Taryn's was glossed over.  Her reactions to steps in her relationship with Angel seems &#34;disproportionate&#34; to her experiences with her father, and with Jack.  I thought it a bit unusual that she went from &#34;not trusting&#34; Angel to save her life in the rapids, yet immediately made love with him on the creek banks.And I wish she had delved further into how Angel got his injury - the scar on his neck was reference often but always with a &#34;the other guy was worse&#34; without more details.  I wish we had learned more about Angel's military experiences.There were lots of good parts of this book - I loved how Angel discovered things about himself by becoming a Grove Leader for a bunch of 7 year old girls ... I bet those girls LOVED him (and I'm surprised the moms didn't flock to him more).  I loved how he became more and more comfortable with the girls over time, and in the end, wore the wreath on his head in the parade. I was glad that he came to the realization that he was wrong to leave Taryn, although I think she took him back too easily.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED how her boys constantly came to her rescue - with her &#34;pity party&#34; after Angel broke up with her, and when Angel approached her at the parade.  I could literally see them squaring up to Angel in that scene.So, I felt this was a good, but maybe not a great installment in the Fools Gold series.  But, Susan has set up a lot of future romances that I really look forward to - Jack and Larissa, and Sam and Dellina. The &#34;boys&#34; have some great personalities and I look forward to reading their stories.",3.0
5831,"My college roommate urged me to read this series, and I tried... Oh, how I tried. I spent three weeks on bed rest at the end of my pregnancy, then my entire maternity leave, then most of the summer trying to get through Oryx and Crake (book one), to say nothing of the rest of the trilogy. While I loved the writing -- and I do love Margaret Atwood's prose -- the book just couldn't hold my attention. I think it's the subject matter: dystopian fiction just isn't for me. The world we have is scary and screwed up enough without reading about how much worse everything will be in a not-so-distant future for entertainment. I'm not such an escapist that everything I read has to be sweetness and light--I read a lot of history, a lot of true crime, and plenty of general fiction about fairly grim subjects--but I'm frightened enough about what our world is coming to that I don't want to read a post-apocalyptic account of the world my kids will inherit, especially not while I'm at home recovering from and celebrating the birth of one of those kids.",2.0

5841,"As a registered nurse, I was privy to many scenes reminiscent of those described in Butler's eye-opening, mind-blowing book. &#34;Slow Codes&#34; were a routine part of our care of the dying, when family members insisted upon doing &#34;everything possible&#34; for a loved one whose time had clearly come to die. Staff took their time responding in order to allow the patient time to go. If we insist on pulling out all the stops when clearly the best course is simply to stop, the dying pay the price for our guilt or misguided sense of love and devotion.After my father was involved in an ultimately-fatal car accident, each specialist told me, in a family meeting, why we should resuscitate if his heart stopped for a second time. &#34;He would be in a wheelchair, with a ventilator and a colostomy . . . .&#34; This was a totally independent man prior to the crash. I insisted on a Do Not Resuscitate order, knowing that it's what he would have wanted.This is a must-read for anyone who might ever be in a position to make medical decisions for a family member or friend. From a professional and personal standpoint, I wholeheartedly endorse Katy Butler's position regarding the acutely and chronically ill as well as the dying.&#34;Knocking on Heaven's Door&#34; will draw in the skeptics and convert them to believers.

5842,"Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review.I&#8217;ve been waiting for more of Hannah and Jack since I finished Bad Boy Rock Star, and Bad Boy vs Millionaire did not disappoint. We pick up a little after the end of Bad Boy Rock Star and find Hannah in Japan to find out why she was summoned by her father, and to clear her head about everything with Jack.Hannah feels that something is &#8220;off&#8221; when she meets up with her dad after a weird run in with Tamaki and now her dad&#8217;s taking her shopping for expensive clothes and she&#8217;s going to dinner with Tamaki and his father. Her dad is forcing her to spend time with Tamaki and even though he seems nice, her heart really isn&#8217;t in it.When Hannah gets back to the US things are a little stressed with her and the band, and Tamaki follows her back. Basically putting Hannah in a love triangle she does not want to be in. Jack wants her, she wants Jack, Tamaki wants her, but she doesn&#8217;t really feel him, but is trying to do what she believes is right for her father. When Jack gives her an ultimatum, I&#8217;m sure she is going to do one thing, and I get pissed.Not until the very end do we know how it all plays out, but there are times you like Tamaki and other times you want to slap him, you begin to wonder if he even cares about Hannah or if she&#8217;s just property to him.Things are crazy in this book, and Candy J. Starr has you guessing every chapter where its going or what is going to happen. I loved getting Angie&#8217;s POV in this book as well.

5845,"Unfortunately, much of what is written in this book is incorrect. It was Operation Red Wings, not Operation Redwing. It was always a Marine operation and the SEALs were just a small part of the larger operation. The opposing force which killed 3 of the 4 SEALs was estimated to be approximately 35 by three different investigative groups, including one group who surveyed the actual site of the firefight, and not the 80-200 claimed in the book. And there never was a vote to determine if the SEALs would kill or not kill the civilians.Only a few of the reviewers seemed to focus on the biggest issue&#8230; which was the poor decision-making of the SEAL team after encountering the three goatherds. Being discovered by those goatherds is what is called a &#8220;soft contact&#8221; or a &#8220;soft compromise.&#8221; It should have been an immediate reason for terminating the mission. That the team waited around for another 90 minutes (according to the author &#8211; which could also be an untruth) and was still attempting to conduct the mission, was a huge mistake. The mission had been compromised and should have been immediately aborted.The other issue that is not even mentioned is the strong possibility that the opposing Taliban force had known about the SEALs insertion from their own reconnaissance and not told anything by the goatherds.One of the things that most upset me in reading this story was Luttrell&#8217;s constant bashing of the so-called &#8220;liberal media&#8221; and his frustration in &#8220;having to conform his behavior to the ROE (rules of engagement).&#8221; That is such an ignorant copout. It&#8217;s the military, not civilians, who created the ROE, and those rules make perfect sense when you study them and understand their intent. Any intelligent soldier would understand this&#8230; and Luttrell tries to tell us that SEALs are very smart. Apparently, Luttrell is the exception.After sifting through the truth about the mission and the misinformation provided in this book, here&#8217;s where I finally arrived at:&#9679;  The Taliban knew the SEALs recon team had landed. It was their mountain and they would have had their own scouts keeping an eye out. The odds were low that their position had been given up by the goatherds.&#9679;  The SEALs knowingly took up a position that was not the high ground, which was inherently dangerous.&#9679;  The Taliban got to the SEALs&#8217; hinding place fairly quickly and had the high ground, which put the SEALs in the weaker position.&#9679;  An opposing force of 3:1 is defendable but only if the lower-numbered force has a defendable position. The SEALs (4) were up against an opposing force of approx. 35, which is an 8:1 ratio, which is not survivable even if the SEALs held a defendable position. But in this case, the Taliban not only had an 8:1 advantage, they also held the high ground. Net-net: the four SEALs were in an unsurvivable position. It was a minor miracle that one of them survived.&#9679;  It was not the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; or the Rules of Engagement that led to the deaths of those three SEALs. They were in a war zone against a competent opponent. They caught a bit of bad luck when the goatherds crossed paths with them, but rather than instantly abort the mission as soon as they had been soft compromised (which is what they should have done), they remained in the area, which gave the Taliban forces the time needed to find them and attack.",2.0

5847,"This book would be good for someone who knew almost no math but wanted to get familiar with some of the most important equations from antiquity through the present day. But I have trouble believing that anyone geeky enough to be interested in these equations (especially from 1900 on) would know as little math as the author supposes.I think the average reader is probably more like me - literate in math but definitely not a mathematician. For me, the book was so lacking in details that a lot of it felt like a tease. There are too many cases where the author uses vague analogies to describe what an equation is doing when a few simple lines of high school math would have made it perfectly clear.Having said that, there are a lot of bright spots to the book as well. I really enjoyed the first few chapters where the author talks about the &#34;cult of Pythagoras&#34; and describes how until very recently math was being done with incredibly primitive tools (no words, no equals sign, no plots, not even Arabic numerals - it's amazing anything got done at all!), and it's striking how rapidly mathematics would develop when things we take for granted today were introduced (for instance, calculus was invented less than 200 years after the equals sign was introduced, and less than 100 years after people started plotting equations).There were also a few bright spots in the latter half of the book. I enjoyed the chapter on set theory/cardinality, which is so elementary that it can be explained in relative detail without any prior knowledge of mathematics, and yet which has some incredibly surprising results. The following chapter talks about the 'completeness' of mathematics and presents the recent but revolutionary proof that no set of axioms can be &#34;complete&#34; (in other words, for any set of axioms, there must be other statements which are at once true and unprovable - in other words, other axioms).All together, this book was worth reading, but it could have been so much better.",3.0

5855,"The book doesn't just deliver but does so in a way that is clear, concise, user friendly and result driven. It's a fast read but don't let that fool you...every page is packed full of great information, engaging examples and objective information the reader can put into practice. There were only a couple of areas which were a tad vague...for example, the author presents information on how NOT to stand but fails to provide examples on how to stand. Aside from these very minor points, the book made it to my 'must keep' collection for future reference. A few of the observations were so 'spot on' that both myself and spouse got a good laugh...as a college instructor, I fit one profile almost perfectly...a known defect of my own communication style. Overall this is a MUST read!",5.0

5864,"I received this book via BookTribe to give an honest review.There is something about psychological  thrillers that just pull me in. Once I started I could not put it down.  You have an awesome plot that just keeps twisting, a nice OH WOW totally didn't see that coming moment. Megan's husband is an abusive man, and Megan is trying to forget him. Along the way she meets Dr. Adrian who she starts dating, but it seems as soon as they start weird things happen. She thinks her ex-husband is back and is going to make her life a living hell, along with Adrian's.Conrad is not a normal person he seems to have some suped up abilities which come in handy for him to find his ex-wife and her lover.I really enjoyed the background of the story being insanity? Can you prove someone is legally insane? That is hard to do. But within this book it makes you think about it.The characters were nice. The problem I had with this book is the fact it seemed the two main character Megan and Adrian didn't date quite enough before they &#34;jumped&#34; into the relationship. Megan wanted to wait a while before Adrian came into her child's life which I think is just great for a mom to do. But it seemed it happened quicker within the story. It was like bam they meet, then they go on a date, then lets wait before you meet my daughter, then okay you can meet her. I felt as though they didn't develop enough of a relationship within the story. It was hard to feel their feelings for each other, it just didn't feel real.Also some scenes seemed a bit rushed. Like the author was trying to get back to the main part of the story so he wanted to rush with the details. I think maybe if he slowed down a bit and added more details then it would have worked.If you like thrillers, I would for sure give this book a read. I know I do want to read more by him in the future to see what else he has to offer.",4.0

5874,"Just read this book. Long interest in ""animals' vs ""people"". Philosophy perfesser, I'm afraid. I find this author's writing style absolutely engaging. Much of the argument - about recursion, etc -is getting old hat by now to the human population interested in the topic, but it is well and humorously presented here by a guy whose first language isn't even English! Also, we've got the ""theory of mind"" issue and what the author calls ""mental time travel"".Perhaps the most thought provoking remark in the book is that if we had the 20 or so Hominins now extinct  existing, we'd not need to ask the question of why we're so ""different"". Think about the almost miraculous activity of, say, ants raising mushrooms. But in the ants' case(s) we can almost always track the intermediate steps kind of spoiling the illusion. But here we are, seemingly alone and different with no stepping stones in sight.There's a theme here that just is part of the default thinking of almost everybody who writes or talks about the rise of humanity, if that's what you want to call it. Kudzu, house sparrows, the fungus wiping out species of amphibians as we speak, well, they're WEED SPECIES! Us, well, we're SPECIAL! Not some hominin escaped from an environment to devaste our new neighborhoods. Does ""mental time travel"" make us a special case as an animal? What if an ant psychologist wrote this book? Well, she couldn't write, you say. Yes, but we can't do a lot of ant things, either. There's just a lot of ""religion"" involved in the assumptions here. As someone who spends hours watching my honeybees behave, I think we've got hardly a clue about the mental lives of our fellow creatures. But you'll enjoy this book. It's about where we are now.",4.0

When SGT Jim Chee is sent to investigate a missing girl and a stolen horse, he finds the man who was wounded, dead, buried in Navajo tradition on the mountain. But not quite... Being a shaman in training himself, he spots the discrepancy in the body preparation which no true traditional would have made. He finds another puzzle. Why would a traditional Navajo like Ashey Begay, make this kind of mistake in burying his kin? And where was he? This puzzle takes Chee off the reservation to Los Angeles in pursuit of the missing girl, and the old man. He crosses paths twice with an assassin who is assigned to kill the girl and all the other witnesses in a crime committed in the big city of LA.

Harlow is just the outcast and the quiet , loner type but Grant can't help but see her for who se really is which is a normal girl just looking for love.

Carolina and Jake are in a word: real. I know the situation (Pres daughter/Secret Service guy) is fun fantasy, but Simcox creates real characters with real feelings and all of that comes across on the page. The emotion between Carolina and Jake is believable and kept me reading until the very end and then I was disappointed it was over. Simcox shows a quick wit and very funny dialogue along with interesting secondary characters. And she managed to keep me riveted about two people holed up in a cabin with lots of freezing snow (which I would hate!) and wanting more.

5909,"THIS is the way to write romantic fantasy.This story is better than the synopsis sounds.  The writing is very good.Currently $1.14 for Kindle version and $1.99 for the Audible version.  WELL worth it.First off I'll admit Romances typically are not my thing.  Now, I don't mind some romance in my stories, if done well, and not too angsty, have a love triangle and or insta-love, but too often I've found in books labeled &#34;Romance&#34; everything but the &#34;romance&#34; seems thrown in as window dressing.However, there are a few notable exceptions, and this is one of them.  I'd label this Romance/Fantasy.  There is an actual, real plot here.  Not too complex a plot, but in this case that didn't matter to me.  Because, the writing is excellent, the world in which it takes place is well drawn, as are secondary characters, and it was a real pleasure to read this story.  The author knows how to tell a story, set a scene and give us characters we can like and care about.Bonuses: Our heroine is feisty, and our hero, while having his grumpy, testy moments, is not a jerk.If you like Romances that are more than thrown together to be devoured and forgotten, and you can enjoy some fantasy and adventure elements mixed in, then you may very well like this one.If you enjoy fantasy, adventure, with a plucky heroine and don't mind a bit of romance in the mix, then you also may enjoy this one.And with a Kindle price of $1.14 there's not much risk giving it a try.",5.0

I found Breakaway by Lindsay Paige on a &#8220;Best Hockey Romance&#8221; list on Goodreads.

(27 books in 2014 &#8211; by January 29!)Lindsay Paige and Mary Smith have a fantastic duel voice in this book, told from both Levi and Presley&#8217;s perspectives, you can&#8217;t help but fall in love with both of them!Levi Carr is dark and twisty &#8211; just the way we like our Hockey Hunks, right? He&#8217;s had it rough, and he takes his aggression out on Trevor McCarthy &#8211; his rival since high school. And when he finds out that McCarthy has a sister, he knows the perfect way to get under his rivals skin! Until&#8230; (predictably) her falls for Presley. Hard. I love watching Levi grow and change through this story. So well done, and so great to be inside the male perspective!Presley is a bit different for me. I have sympathy for her &#8211; but she lets her brother and dad walk all over her. And that pisses me off. But then, she lets herself fall into Levi and I love her for it &#8211; I can only hope that as this series goes on (it&#8217;s a trilogy!) that she finds a backbone of her own.The authors have a solid story, albeit predictable.

Levi is a good guy, and this is a strong story.If you&#8217;re into YA and want to venture into the world of sports romance? This is the book for you!

I loved each story.Zero by Rene Folsom ~ Great read that really has me hoping that Rene will continue with this story, maybe like her Soul Seers series.  I will resort to begging her for more.  I absolutely NEED to kno if it was Mason with CJ at the end or if it was someone else!Isaac by Michael Loring ~ Interesting take on andrioids that are extremely human like.  They are companion androids.  They help with housework and keep their human company and help take care of them.  They have human functions and can eat and actually think for themselves.  They have their own personalities as well.  They also have feelings.World Gone Wrong by Bart Hopkins ~ What happens when you wake up one day and the internet is completely gone?  Well, that happened to Simeon, Karina, and Messler.  The Government has shut it down to make Earth better.  People depend on it way too much and they don't think for themselves anymore, just google whatever they need.  They find out there is an Earth 2 and there will be a lottery to go there.  Really want to know if Karina waited or not.Life Companion by ML Ryan ~ This is a story about what happens when people decide to &#34;create&#34; others to match what they want in a companion/spouse.  I loved how this story showed how much you loose by creating your perfect match.  Very interesting and an enjoyable read.Born Ready by Katheryn Van Pelt ~ Very interesting read.  I do want to know the rest of Alex's story, after she escapes again.Show Me by Magen McMinimy ~ Yet another story by Magen that has completely sucked me in and left me wanting more.  Was a great read.  It was interesting how the aliens are shape shifters and what they truly look like.New Eden by Eaton Thomas Palmer ~ Another interesting read of a mated pair, or their bond/love.  Just how far will it reach through the galaxies and what lengths you will go to for the one you love.  I really liked it.Love Forgotten by Stephanie Summers ~  This is a great read about having, and using, way too much technology.  When you become so dependent on it, and have artificial inteligence do everything for you, you miss out on so much.What Happens on Destiny 2 by Tara Moeller ~  Great read.  I love how both the main characters got a very big surprise by seeing each other.  I wasn't expecting what the cargo ship was carrying either.Brandy by Carrie Avery Moriarty ~  Wow, what a great story to end the anthology on.  It really left me wanting more.  I need to know if he came back or not!Overall, I love this anthology.  Most of the stories left me wanting more.",5.0

5929,"I've read all of the critical reviews and am surprised that I'm at variance with so many reviewers I generally agree with. It hardly seems fair to complain that a book titled ""A Regency Short Story"" is too short. And I totally don't agree that the book is not romantic. He's been in love with her for 10 years! When she asks him why he never married he tells her because he only ever wanted her. Sigh. That won me over.As for character development and plot, maybe reading a lot of short stories has trained me for what to expect. And this story does a decent job of alluding to how the hero and heroine met (she's best friends with his sister), why they didn't marry 10 years ago and what her married life was like. I got a very clear picture of why she was reluctant to remarry. There is no repetition in this book (or any good short story) so skimmers may miss a critical element to the plot or character development because it won't be repeated.From reading the reviews I thought this book was only going to be sex and was pleasantly surprised there was very little actual sex. It's mostly passionate embraces, seduction and the hero convincing the heroine to trust him and trust herself to love him. I thought this book would fit perfectly in a short story anthology likeThe Mammoth Book of Regency Romance (Mammoth Books). This is not a novella! If you actually like short stories, which I do, then I would recommend this book for a fast read. Perfect for bedtime reading, waiting for an appointment or a quick diversion.",5.0

I have been using it in conjunction with band in a box which makes for a great way to listen to the different examples in the book. However when I say there is a lot of content in the book I'm not joking. This one is going to take some time to get though and really absorb. Also because of the amount of examples in the book it's going to take some time to really experiment with the different examples and techniques in the book. Luckily there is a quick reference list in the back of the book that will allow you to quickly look up a topic and find the related example in the book. Overall I would highly recommend this book to others.

I don't normally read books about True Crime but I'm very glad I made this purchase.If you are interested in True Crime and the steps law enforcement takes to bring a killer to justice this book is for you. Very gripping account of a young woman's disappearance and told in such detail that it will make you keep on reading.  The detailed account of when Amy was discovered (autopsy and officers personal accounts of what they saw) was something that left a lasting impression on me that won't go away.  A great effort by 2 authors who bring you a true story like not many can. Its hard to imagine what it must have been like living in Portland, Maine when this all unfolded.

I can imagine the author was attempting to write without benefit of any research. She fails to develop a storyline that makes sense.

The overall plot is realistic and well-executed except when Mahir brought his 17 year old nephew in to help solve the case. That was a bit unbelievable and would not happen in the real world. The main characters, Mahir, aka Saeed, and David, aka Ridley were superbly developed.  While it is not traditional romance, there is no mistaking Mahir and Ridley&#8217;s emotions run deep. The sex was hot and so erotic. All in all, a really good novel that I highly recommend.",4.0
5950,"Brigitta is at it again! I'm not the target audience, but my 11year old daughter is and she's captivated by a fairy story with some depth and gravitas. The author has constructed a rich and detailed world with a complex mythology and worldview. I hesitate to call it a religion as magic is an accepted way things work as opposed to a belief.But in every quest, there's obstacles and risks of not completing the quest. With this book, the stakes are even higher than before but our little Briggita has some help this time, instead of just going it alone. I'm reminded of Tolkien as Briggita is forced to go out side of her version of the shire and banish the demons and save the way of life of her family and friends. It's a selfless act but she knows she's the only one can.I've also enjoyed the way Dinsmore moves back and forth between Briggita's quest and Ondelle's memories. We learn more of the history of the world and she answers questions brought up in the first two books.I can hardly wait for the next book !",4.0

5956,"Before this book the only critique I encountered on the flaws, faults, foibles of fundamentalist dogma came from Karen Armstrong who in an afterword of her History of God, I think, commented that people inclined toward fundamentalism were a real and growing pain Her discussion pointed to all fundamentalists--not just guys who misread the Koran or Bible (both Old and New Testaments) or etc..I had also found fundamentalists a pain.  They have  a huge soapbox in America, where we are so inclined to wanting to be fair and balanced and are so polite, that the fundamentalist spokes folk always got their say after someone rational asserted the validity of climate change or evolution or not being narrow minded and pointed in the wrong direction by rotten leaders.The climate issue would be dismissed on religious grounds because God gave us the earth to exploit, not husband.  As for evolution, I was stunned to see a stage full of candidates for the most powerful office in the world raise their hands if they did not believe in evolution.  This act amounted to insanity by dogma or to owning the moral compass of a two year old who is all Id and would shove its hand through Mommy's heart if it could get to a cookie on the other side. Here Mommy's heart is whatever it takes to be elected and the cookie is the Presidency.Anyway, Dawkins' book was like sinus relief finally kicking in after years of no help because everybody is polite in America and no one dared say, ""You guys are starkers and stand down.  Your Book is a book with some good ideas that should be open to interpretation and not enforced so you deny all reason, humane rights to others, whatever else you choke to death because you think you know with certainty The Good News.Dawkins unloaded on boobery and shot down every lame argument I ever heard voiced by the guy who had to be accorded equal time.  Dawkins did this systematically and thoroughly. In fact, he did it so well that some critics took him to task for being thorough: they thought he had gone on too long in his detailing the other guy's errors--""Come on you didn't have to reply to every dumb thing fundamentalists have said,"" was their critique.For me it was a sinus rinse of the brain. Here sinuses represent...and flush means... (If you got this far, you are sharp enough to get the point.)Anyhow , I recently saw John Oliver demonstrate the generally held truth of climate change.  Rather than showing two people arguing different views on the issue, he put three guys on one side representing CC deniers who were posed even wearing white lab coats and then brought out ninety-seven other guys also in white coats to represent the percentage of scientist who see CC as a fact.Ah, what a relief it is.",5.0
5957,"Passion: The Bright Light of Glory is a compilation of all the best sermons from the various speakers at Passion over the years.  Stories and insights from passionate believers like John Piper, Beth Moore, Francis Chan, and even Louie Giglio himself fill the pages with inspiring words, challenging the next generation to rise up and be real for Jesus.  Isaiah 26:8 sets the stage for Passion's mission--that the Name and renown of Jesus Christ would be the desire of our souls.  How are we going to act on that desire?As I read through this book, all I could say to the people around me was, &#34;Oh my gosh, it's just so good.  You just have to read it.  It's so good.&#34;  Chapter after chapter, I continued to be blown away.  Encouragement on one page, deep challenge on the next.  Conviction on one page, grace on the next. Some of the chapters so deeply challenged me and twisted my brain into such awesome knots (thank you, John Piper)... I also really enjoyed the diversity between the teachers.I'm so grateful for the passion of each of these individuals for the Lord Jesus Christ.  This book was fantastic--an excellent read for anyone looking to grow in their faith, to be challenged to live out their theology, to be emboldened with the weight of Gospel.I give Passion: The Light of Glory 5 out of 5 stars!I received this book free of charge from Book Look Bloggers in exchange for an honest review.",5.0

5968,"Lothaire is one of the most complex characters we&#8217;ve come across in this series, acting as Nix&#8217;s main adversary or the Black King to her White Queen. Spurred on by his mother, Lothaire plans to hold both the Horde and Dacian crowns. He is teetering on the brink of madness however as he regularly drank from supernatural creatures as he killed them. This gave him untold knowledge (and therefore power) but he is plagued by their memories. If you think about the memories one human could amass in their life time and then multiply that by thousands of years and thousands of people, then it&#8217;s pretty amazing that he has been able to maintain his tenuous grip on reality.Lothaire is convinced that the goddess Saroya that inhabits Ellie Pierce&#8217;s body must be his true mate and not Ellie herself. Why would fate curse him with a human as his bride and a backward hick at that? His arrogance and stupidity made me question how he managed to stay alive for so long. Lothaire&#8217;s desperate and manic search for the ring he thinks will expel Ellie from her body becomes becomes a double-edged sword when he realises he cannot stop even if he wanted to. Lothaire&#8217;s definitely not your typical hero and even he acknowledges that he is bad to the core. His treatment of Ellie was pretty appalling but not that surprising, considering what other Cole heroes get up to. I can say though it fit the character perfectly based on what we had seen of him in other novels apart from his IQ which dropped significantly. For someone who has spent thousands of years plotting, he demonstrated fairly little foresight.Ellie was a pretty interesting character as she was constantly underestimated by the Lore creatures. She showed grit and remained surprisingly upbeat given the crappy cards that life gave her. Waking up from a blackout to discover that the creature inhabiting your body had gone one a killing spree had to suck. I loved her resourcefulness, humour and the fact that her strength of will was so strong it could stop a goddess from getting her own way.  I couldn&#8217;t stand her accent though which was poured on so thick I almost needed a translator.I am really disappointed that I can&#8217;t muster up the level of outrage for Lothaire&#8217;s treatment of Ellie that it deserves. When I first read A Hunger Like No Other I was horrified at the brutal way Lachlain treated Emmeline but I found myself almost rationalising the emotional and mental abuse Lothaire inflicted on Ellie because he&#8217;d had a dodgy childhood. His attitude meant the sex scenes (can&#8217;t call them love as there wasn&#8217;t much in the way of that) awkward as Ellie was literally doing whatever it took to stay alive. Any feelings she had for him felt contrived as she had been isolated from society for so long. I know this is a romance so it is supposed to end happily ever after for our leads but the speed at which Ellie forgave his actions was a bit much given the way he hurt her. We&#8217;ve seen the Stockholm Syndrome quite a few times in this series so I wish that Cole would move on and try something different.I really enjoyed secondary characters such as the Hag, Nix and Thad but the world is getting so big that it is a little unwieldy. I almost feel like I need a relationships chart at the start to keep all the characters straight in my head. It might have actually been better to pair Lothaire up with someone we were already aware of like Nix as a way of keeping the numbers down. Not all the scenes value add and some could easily have been trimmed such as the Mariketa trying to find Ellie.So where do I stand? Lothaire is objectionable, his motives questionable and his romance skills laughable. He was however a really complex layered creature and that takes skill to create. Ellie was a joy that frankly deserved that imaginary man she dreamed of who would work hard, love her and give her a couple of kids. I can&#8217;t honestly say I enjoyed this novel but it did stick with me for a while after I read it, hence my rating.",4.0

I just wish he wasn't such a downer. anyway, the book resolves itself very well, but I wonder if the characters will ever really be as trusting or loving, or even feel slightly safe, ever again.

5983,"After reading the first in the Dreams of Chaos series I found myself diving headlong into the second book &#34;Tilt&#34; with a lot of eagerness and a great deal of anticipation on seeing what kind of adventure Ashley Chappell had Trotter the goddess on next. And, just like in &#34;Alice Will&#34;, this second novel is wonderfully imaginative, filled with colorful and vibrant writing, and has a fantastic leading character that makes you root for her as she navigates a place filled of gods and goddesses, magic, multiple worlds, magical beings and more.In &#34;Tilt&#34; we find Trotter banished from the pantheon of Realm to Aevum where she lives a lonely existence shunted away from her parents because of nothing more than politics and refusing to be forced to chose a dominion. Trotter's world is once again wreaked havoc on as Aevum begins to tilt into an eternal darkness and it's up to her to not only figure out the cause, but to save the two worlds that have been caught up in a far reaching plot she may finally have to choose a dominion after all.What I liked about this second book is that it builds upon the first, drawing you in farther into the mind of Trotter and the worlds she lives in; weaving an imaginative tale and spinning layers of characters development and intriguing concepts onto each other in interesting ways. The novel has the same spark and vibrancy as the first, using the author's talent for writing to take this fast-paced and exciting plot into a whole new realm (if you pardon the pun).From the complex coming-of-age nuances to the strong female lead in Trotter that inspires and resonates with the reader, this is an excellent continuation to the series that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading it. I would certainly recommend it (and the first in the series, &#34;Alice Will&#34;) to readers who are looking for a fantastically creative novel to sink their teeth into.",5.0

5988,"I loved this book! The author, Collette West, has created a contemporary romance with some really lovable characters with complicated issues. Chase is trying to overcome the stigma of being a baseball media darling as well as the personal frustration of a side-lining injury. Grey has a lurking sadness that prevents her from living her life in the present and giving herself permission to love and be happy. I picked up this book on the promise of a heartfelt romance mixed with great baseball prose, which seemed a hard marriage to strike. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. This book has both and was enchanting from the outset.My favorite aspect of this book is the amount of effort the author put into allowing the reader time to discover who these characters were as individuals first. Long before the reader even suspects the possibility of a love connection between Chase and Grey, the reader has had time to fall in love with each character on their own, learn their issues, and cheer for them to overcome their respective battles. Then, when Chase and Grey finally do investigate their attraction, it&#8217;s like a tidal wave of pent up emotion and energy is finally released. And though I won&#8217;t throw in any spoilers here, the overall sexiness of this book is appealing because of the delayed gratification the author puts the reader through.I personally adore a heart-pounding, sweaty-palmed love story. I also personally abhor these romances where the characters we hardly know &#8220;fall in love&#8221; at first sight and are knee-deep in a relationship less than 24 hours later. We all know most real love stories don&#8217;t work that quickly. So, I loved the time the author afforded us with such delightful, and at times frustrating, characters. And the pacing of Chase and Grey&#8217;s romance was spot on and very satisfying.Well done, Ms. West. This book is much-deserving of the 5 stars I&#8217;m giving it.",5.0

5991,"I read this last night and was only going to read a bit before going off to bed. As it was I ended up staying up until I had finished it! I can't really tell you what sort of book this is as it seems to cover various genres including fantasy, humour, romance.It is very well written and you find yourself agreeing with, or laughing at, the heroine almost from the start. For example &#34;Now, she was expected to go out stark naked for a showdown with a god. Her mouth quirked. Yula was right. Instead of freaking over the god part, she was spazzing over the nudity.&#34;The author is obviously well versed with &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; as there are a couple references made to it.All in all, for me, this is a keeper for my kindle app!

5994,"Fast, easy, stunning book.  These people, all four of them, are worse than I imagined.  Their marriages sound miserable.  Their lives in politics worse.Klein does not hold back, and it is clear that none of these people has anything but contempt for the truth - they lie often, they lie glibly, and they lie when they don't need to.Hillary constructed lies (with Obama's help) even as the Benghazi murders were taking place.  It is significant that their first thoughts weren't how they were going to help those still under attack but how they were going to protect their behinds with a cover story.  One often hears that the coverup is worse than the crime.  In this case, I think doing nothing while Americans under your protection were being murdered is actually worse than covering up your incompetence.  This reminded me of when Ted Kennedy ran to a nearby house to prepare his legal defense while he left his date, Ms. Kopechne, to die slowly, trapped in a dwindling air bubble, in the dark, cold water of the creek Ted had driven his car into.  Me first, My Victims Later (if ever).  Hillary, it should be remembered, had an obscure filmmaker thrown in prison solely to support what she knew to be untrue, the ridiculous claim that an internet video caused the Benghazi attack.Obama's total lack of character and juvenile personality are on display throughout Klein's book.  At Jarrett's urging, Obama apparently agreed to back Hillary in the next presidential election in exchange for Bill's support when Obama was running for a second term.  But Obama and Jarrett agreed that they could promise anything and then renege once he was elected which, in fact, is what he did, thus re-igniting the feud between the two families.Rather than look for examples of Obama's dishonesty, I watched for examples of honesty.  I couldn't find any.  &#34;Let me be clear&#34; (customary prelude to another lie), if you like your doctor you can . . . . .oh well, you should know by now.The only attractive and obviously intelligent personality in this quadrangle appears to be Bill Clinton.  Without him, Hillary is going down the tubes fast and she seems bitterly to resent her need for him.It is truly something, come to think of it, that the best of these four was President while Americans were shot down at Ruby Ridge and burned to death at Waco, and that he lost his law license and was impeached for lying in a judicial proceeding (not, as some think, for having an affair).  Yeah, he is the best of these four.  At least the country prospered when he was President if you overlook the needless slaughter of a few citizens here and there.Edward Klein has written a splendid and very necessary book.",5.0

5996,"***May contain spoilers, not that it matters***The story concept is decent: space explorers come into contact with an unfriendly alien race and humanity must defend itself against possible invasion. Everything else about the book is flawed: the dialogue is stilted, character development is virtually nil, paragraphs run on too long. The author's inability to use conventional methods for including dialogue in a narrative is jarring and makes the book very difficult to read. He also can't seem to decide whether or not to use abbreviations for military ranks and switches back and forth frequently.The book's world is broadly drawn but there is no color, no detail, no depth. The same can be said for the characters. They have no backstories, no history, and no personalities. The aliens are nameless, faceless; there is almost no description of their ships, no attempt to capture or interrogate the attackers. There are no attempts at diplomacy, the human race simply jumps from peaceful exploration to all-out war, building an enormous space fleet with no debate and no explanation of how they are able to afford to build ships.Perhaps worst of all is the main character's &#34;vision&#34;, which allows him to &#34;see&#34; into the future. This deus ex machina allows the main character to win battles and promotions. Maybe the second book of the series is going to explain how and why this happens, but I'm not going to stick around to find out.There are numerous grammatical and spelling mistakes, which is inexcusable in a book being offered for sale. Just because you're self-published is no reason for such sloppiness. These mistakes are distracting and make the book even less enjoyable.The author's comment at the end is nothing but a whiny plea for 4 and 5 star reviews and even goes so far as to ask people to mark &#34;unfairly critical&#34; reviews as unhelpful. Really? Isn't it enough that, as it appears to me, you had all your friends and family post glowing reviews to artificially inflate the overall rating of the book?I wish I could get my money back on this one.",2.0

6004,"No-holds-barred indictment of postmodernist approaches to Biblical scholarship.  Dever spends chapter after chapter eviscerating (by name) a variety of scholars who variously claim that ancient Israel is a fiction, an insignificant band of slaves, or a wholly modern construct.  This ideological beatdown is interspersed with a thoughtful, comprehensive survey of our archaeological understanding of ancient Israel - among the best available to the interested layman.  Dever lets the archaeological evidence do the talking and walks the reader through the various types of evidence that point to the emergence of Israel in early first millennium B.C.E.But if you've come looking for an archaeologist to &#34;prove&#34; the Bible you've come to the wrong place.  Dever's clear conclusion is that the archaeological facts don't always match the Biblical accounts.  He makes a strong case for the historicity of Israel without the same case for the inerrancy of the Biblical record.  Dever's indictment of ideologically-motivated biblical archaeology uses words less strong than the ones chosen against the postmodernists, but he accuses them post of picking and choosing facts to match a particular worldview.All in all, Dever comes across as a passionate moderate who sees his chosen field of study threatened by politically motivated amateurs who ought to know better.  The final chapters expand the scope of his accusations to all of modern academia, who conflate scholarship with politics or social change losing facts, evidence, and compelling truth in the process.  His indignation is righteous and often entertaining.",5.0

6011,"There is always a great pleasure when one finds a sequel to a good book one read recently that is as interesting as the first one. This book is darker than the first one but as interesting and well written.The hero and his two lady friends (the succubus and the angel) have developed a deep emotional relationship  that is based on often and exciting sex, but even more on the love and trust that they have for each other. To make life more interesting, two pretty witches (mainly lesbian but not adverse to  an occasional fling with the hero) have Alex wondering where his life is going to. The previous book had him, his female and male friends battling for life and winning. This time, the situation is more serious. There are werewolves who want him dead (especially the pack leader after he rejects her amorous advances),  vampires want him dead since he killed one of their leaders, and now the federal government has a special  task force looking for the group. There is even an angel  who wants him dead as a career move. The final battle resolves very satisfyingly most issues.As in the first book, there are erotic encounters with all details most male readers would enjoy, the interaction among the friends is getting deeper and more profound, the action is exciting and bloody, and all is well written . A diifent book from the first one, but as satisfying. Very recommendable &#8211; based on the two samples I have read now I would not hesitate to buy other books by this author.",5.0

Since I don't read about time travel, I found it quite unbelievable, so I had to stop and put the book down after about 20 pages or so.

While I cannot imagine what it is like to lose my spouse (of 40 years so far), Par takes the reader on a journey into her life of being a refugee, to a new start, to million-dollar success, tragedy and how to rebuild. As someone who has &#8220;been there,&#8221; she shares her story and what others can do to prepare financially before tragedy strikes.How to Protect What Matters Most does a great job of simplifying the confusing world of life insurance. She makes it clear that she prefers cash value insurance over term insurance, and even gives some of the reasons why. Clearly, there are two sides to the coin and concerning insurance, there&#8217;s not a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; answer. However, this book is a great place to start if you&#8217;re trying to make sense of the life insurance maze.I have passed this book along to my husband so he can evaluate our current policies, and will share this same information with my grown children.

High frequency trading, the practice of taking advantage of high speed mini transactions to exploit differences in prices between stock exchanges (to oversimplify the practice) is not only taking advantage of market inefficiencies but actually introducing inefficiencies in order to purposely cheat the investor out of literally billions a year.Michael Lewis tells a great story and continues to underline the fact that Wall Street in large part cares little about much other than making money and will cheat and game the system to do it.  It requires focused attention to read and follow, as the methods for manipulation are complex.

I wanted to just strangle Sophie, but when she was sent to Uganda I watched as she left her eyes open to what the rest of the world must to in order to live.  The thought of surviving to live was something she had never had to experience.  Ian was not only handsome, but a strong character for Sophie while she opened her heart to the children in the orphanage.  Watching him see Sophie experience compassion towards strangers drew me as the reader towards the empathy of the situation.  I wanted to help them help the people of Africa.  This was a great story of love, romance, pain, survival and a true example of what a single choice can do to a persons life.  It just depends on how you walk that path you've chosen that can make you that type of hero people talk about.  Great Read!!",5.0

I read my original copy until the cover fell apart and the pages came loose, and then I had to buy a new copy.  Plague Dogs is also very good.  This is a wonderful author and an amazing instant classic of a book, not just a kid's book but good for grownups too, at least for me.  Reading it reminds me of feelings I'd forgotten I had as a child and every time, it just sweeps me away.  A must read for anyone, and I'm into zombies and sly horror, and Stephen King, and stuff that freaks my mother out.  But these daggone rabbits are amazing.  And like I tell my friends, no, it is not just some big ole book about rabbits hopping around and ravaging carrots and pooping everywhere.  It is a story that makes me remember I want to be the protagonist in my own life, and makes me look at my cats with a little less love, and a hint of suspicion every time I read this book!

6030,"Joe De Sena's ""Spartan Up!"" is in an interesting book which combines exercise and dietary advice with really hardcore motivational advice.  I initially thought this book was going to be solely about ways to get stronger physically and lose weight, since De Sena is the inventor of ""The Spartan Race"", a truly cruel and gutsy race which one has to pay to become a part of.  In it, people do things like carry buckets of rocks, tires, jump obstacles, and climb rope without restriction in order to become more fit.  I liked a lot of what De Sena had to say in this book in general, though, about life and how we have to push ourselves sometimes to do what we want.  I am kind of critical of his philosophy in the area of raising children, though: he says in one part of the book that we should *always* make our kids do the hardest thing they possibly can.  Kids should be allowed to be kids, and there should be some balance about it.  Otherwise, this is an excellent motivational book, chiefly because De Sena refuses to lie.

6037,"Arriving in bookstores earlier this year is All Things Hidden written by Tracie Peterson and Kimberly Woodhouse. I'm a fan of Tracie Peterson's Heirs of Montana series, so I eagerly signed up to review this book.All Things Hidden centers on a young nurse named Gwyn Hillerman, who has been working at her father's clinic in Alaska.Business at the clinic picks up with the Matanuska Project occurred, where 200 families were relocated to Alaska in 1935.The novel jumps to Chicago and centers on Dr. Jeremiah Vaughan, who has just lost his medical license after the death of a patient. Shortly after losing his job, his fiancee calls off their engagement. Out the of blue, he receives a job opportunity from Dr. Hillerman to join his clinic in the Alaska Territory. Dr. Vaughan accepts the offer, as his career doesn't have any other choice.Remember this is a love story, so it isn't too long after Dr. Vaughan's arrival that sparks fly between him and Gwyn.Is it just me, or does the woman (Gwyn) on the cover resemble Alice from Disney's Alice in Wonderland? Minus the nurses hat she is holding on to, the outfit looks just like Alice's.Anyway, this isn't the first Tracie Peterson novel set in Alaska, so she must love the state or have ancestors from there. The book is beautifully written by Peterson and her co-author, Kimberly Woodhouse, though there are a few romantic cliches here and there, the overall plot is nicely done. Overall, All Things Hidden was a delight to read for me last month; on a cold winter afternoon with a hot cup of coffee nearby.*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

6046,"If there was any serious quibble I could have had with this book's predecessor, ""Blades of Winter,"" it might be that it was so fizzy, so busy, I COULDN'T quibble with it. It was a video game writ large, and meant to be enjoyed in a spirit of sheer escapism. This I certainly did.But with this book, something different is going on. While undeniably escapist (I lost track of the cartoon-y body count) the heart of ""Hammer"" is deep and serious. For example, 1981 versions of Anne and Margot Frank -- the women they might have been, had Hitler actually been assassinated in 1942 -- play important roles. Justice, bloody and extreme, is served to a new version of the SS and Gestapo.And our narrator, Alix Nico (""Scarlet""), through as quippy and deadly as ever, is coping with a serious case of PTSD. Her role in this outing is to disrupt the Greater Germany that has enslaved Europe since the end of WW II. She disappears into England and France, ready to rain vengeance on German slaveholders, yet still dealing with heartbreak over the loss of her partner Trick, and her father, ""Big Bertha."" She is damaged this time around, and it makes us care about her more.As always, author Almasi's wordplay and humor help defuse the constant ass-kicking his team of Levels deliver. Yet underneath it all, I felt the soul of Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" -- the desire to deliver the justice that real history denied us. True, Alix sounds like no 20-year old girl I've ever known; but the silly romp has become surprisingly relevant , and I can't quibble with that.",4.0

The story of Ellie and Nolan really begins in childhood, but continues when, at the age of 15, family problems separate them and they make a promise to meet again in the far-distant future. Their story from the day of that promise to the scheduled day of the fulfillment makes up most of the book. Go ahead, break your sentimental heart and read this book. It might just mend it, too.

6051,"The Thirty-Nine Steps is one of the earliest spy thrillers and has remained in print since its first book appearance. By today's standards, it's perhaps somewhat tame, the narrative rather slim, and traces of racial and ethnic prejudice appear now and then. Still, it's a rollicking ride that can be appreciated even now, a century after it was written. Hitchcock's film adaptation took the basic idea but made several changes, not the least of which is a complete revamping of the title's meaning. If you've already seen that movie, don't think that will spoil the reading of the original. This edition by Oxford University Press is the one to have, since it's the only (I believe) annotated one, and those notes really help to clarify or explain certain terms and points. And if you like this first outing by hero Richard Hannay, you can go on to its sequels, Greenmantle and Mr. Standfast and The Three Hostages, which are more fully textured.",4.0

6055,"It&#8217;s hard to imagine a society with more transparency and less privacy than the one we currently live in. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and countless numbers of professional and personal blogs, there&#8217;s very little information that&#8217;s truly kept private these days. Sonogram pictures, marital discord, gastrointestinal distress, vacation brags, shopping preferences&#8230;you name it and surely it&#8217;s been made public by someone. Of course, individuals have some control over what information is shared with their adoring public. Only the neediest, most narcissistic of us over share every part of our lives. But what if the choice was taken away from us? What if complete and total participation in all manners of social networking was not optional but entirely mandatory? What if every facet of your life was filtered through and controlled by one monopolistic Internet company? This frighteningly foreseeable book by Dave Eggers proposes just that.Mae can&#8217;t believe her luck when she lands her dream job at The Circle, a tech company best described as Google on steroids. Its reach is all-encompassing, and Mae quickly finds herself brainwashed by the Utopian atmosphere all around her. The company embeds itself in users&#8217; lives by linking and making public every aspect of their online existence: social networks, medical history, banking and financial history, and social life. Their ultimate goal is total transparency consisting of people always being tracked and monitored and public access cameras placed everywhere. While there are clearly many benefits to this type of tracking, specifically safety issues, Mae is too enamored with her fame and status within the company to see the negative implications. She becomes increasingly distanced from her family and friends outside of the company even as they try to warn her of the dangers of such total dominance proposed by The Circle.I was very intrigued by the concept of this book. It seems like something that&#8217;s not too far off the mark from where some of us are at right now with our reliance on technology, social media in particular. There&#8217;s an inherent danger in relying on others to validate your sense of self-worth, especially in an online world. And we&#8217;ve all read about and seen the negative effects of too much screen time at the expense of spending time in the real world. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m as guilty as the next person of wasting too much time on Facebook on occasion. And I&#8217;ve met many wonderful people online who I now consider to be dear friends. But the real danger comes when we look to a non-living entity such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone to make us feel good about ourselves. There&#8217;s no piece of technology that can truly do that. This is an excellent book, if for nothing else to act as a warning of the direction we may be headed.",4.0

She&#8217;s got purple hair, an eccentric wardrobe, and a curvy body that she totally owns! She loves a good horror movie and is a very inquisitive reporter, but the best part is her take-no-crap-from-anybody attitude! She can go from sweet to sassy whenever the situation requires it. And the extra-smoking, extraterrestrial Hayden really brings out her sass! If all aliens are built like Hayden, then bring on the probing! (I had to say it!) But like most swoon-worthy paranormal hotties, he&#8217;s a huge pain in the butt. I love the brewing, steamy romance that buds between them despite all the friction! As if he&#8217;s not enough trouble on his own, he comes attached to an alien brood that immediately seems to hate Sloan. And then there&#8217;s the problem of the government finding out about their little budding friendship, that can&#8217;t be a good thing. Needless to say, there is plenty of action, including some &#8220;HOLY CRAP&#8221; moments that&#8217;ll having you soaring through this book in no time!

I absolutely loved it!What can happen when an incredibly sexy vampire meets a female computer nerd at a ski resort? Both are driven by family loyalties. Neither is looking for a relationship. This book has something for everyone: romance, steamy sex, humor, unique family dynamics and a hero and heroine who will each find their way into your heart.I positively fell in love with Charles. He was a sinfully delicious loner. His task was to find who was threatening his brother's mate. When Rachel, a mousy techie, caught him feeding and attempted to blackmail him, he was intrigued by her. He told himself that it would be inconvenient and certainly detrimental to his plans if Rachel publicly accused him of being a vampire, so he agreed to her demands. She just wanted to protect her sister from a fiance who wasn't good for her. Neither was expecting their own heartstrings to be pulled and the sex to be so HOT!This book can easily be read as a stand-alone. I've not read the 1st book in the series and thoroughly enjoyed this read. I loved it so much that I'm planning to read the 1st in the series soon!Bottomline: The writing was polished. The world and characters the author created are incredible. The plot kept me riveted from beginning to end.

6079,"I've read all of Anne Perry's Victorian novels and am a big fan of her work, in general.  Her earlier works are vibrant, absolutely alive with period detail and color.  They boast a swift tempo with action and suspense harmonized with romance and emotional insight. Her main characters are complex people who develop over time into seasoned and mature persons, credible and likable. The author's typically winning formula hasn't quite come together in this latest novel, in my opinion.  Indeed, her last several novels seem to be more languid and formulaic.  I wonder if Perry is simply getting bored with these characters and this time period?  Death on Blackheath seems tired and often turgid to me. There is a lot of repetitive inner musings by Pitt and not much in the way of real action or suspense.  As his investigation gets bogged down, so does the novel.  Pitt, the recently promoted head of Special Branch has been called in to investigate the sudden disappearance of a housemaid in the home of a naval weapons expert. As the naval race between Britain and Germany was gearing up at the end of the 19th century, it was feared that the maid's disappearance threatened dire implications for national security. That should have provided a tense and urgent scenario for the reader, but somehow, this book never really got off the ground for me.  There were so many thwarted avenues of investigation, not a lot of action, and Pitt's wife Charlotte, a spirited and clever woman who has played important roles in his earlier investigations, has a very limited role in this one. I think a number of Perry fans will find this novel not up to her usual standard, but as every Perry fan also knows, a ho-hum Perry novel is still better than a good many others.",3.0

6083,"I enjoyed this 2nd installment of the Others series.  Granted, not as much as the 1st book, but this still held my interest and kept me up late at night reading.  I liked that some of the plot elements from Book 1 were wrapped up and readers had some clues as to what Book 3 may contain.  I am eagerly anticipating Book 3, scheduled for 3/2015.I didn't rate this 5 stars b/c I felt very strongly that this story lacked much of the freshness and suspense of Book 1.Potential spoilers below:Some thoughts:1.  I missed reading scenes about how Meg provided entertainment for the Others.  She endeared herself to the Others with her simple and sweet mannerisms in book 1.  I loved the long scenes of her traveling in the BOW and how she interacted with the Others. Or the scenes of her work days sorting mail.  Simple and innocent, but provided a great deal of emotional attachment to the character.  In book 2, scenes like that were completely missing.  There was one scene in book 2 where she visits the pony barn.  Well?  The reader isn't given much of that scene, and I think it would have been a great opportunity to bring some sweetness to the story with Meg and Jester.  (Or, how about Whirlpool the Pony befriending Meg? Is Whirlpool coming back in Book 3?  Why a mention here if nothing else happens with that character?)2.  I thought there were WAY too many scenes with the Police.  I started skimming those portions, as the conversations and questions never changed.  On repeat: Police were fearful of and awed by the power/feral nature of the Others, but balanced a line of respect with them in order to work together. What, really, did the Police contribute to the whole plot of this story?  And Dr. Lorenzo?  I just saw him as a whiner and a coward instead of a dynamic and progressive character.3.  I really liked the new Evil Character- Shark Man!  But wait.  We never really learn more about him, and when it's his time in the spotlight----splat.  His shining moment was cut short way too quickly.  This character really could have been fleshed out more and developed.  I thought he was even more evil than the Controller, so why not spread him out over the whole story?4.  Characters: I do like that new names and faces were introduced.  I enjoyed the Intuit characters, and want to know more about them.  Also, what about Nicholas Scratch; who is he, how is he significant, and what does he do?  I bet we will meet more of him in Book 3, but it would have been nice to have a smallish scene with him to get a &#34;taste&#34; for what his character is like.5.  Lastly, Simon and Meg.  I did like that they are (slowly) developing their relationship.  Simon seemed a bit whiny and Meg a little too demanding for how we met her in Book 1.  She has only been living with the Others for 3 months, so I expected her to still have maintained her sweetness, which seemed to have dimmed a bit. I look forward to seeing this relationship grow.I can't help but wonder if this interim book is just a bridge to making connections from Book 1 to Book 3.  Lots of loose ends that seemed to dangle enticingly, so I can hope that these ends will be tied up in Book 3.  I hope Book 3 with be EPIC, with lots of tension, build-up and character development.",4.0

Her latest The Theory of Opposites ranks as one of my favorites &#8211; I double loved this one! Life is all about choices, owning your choices, and the courage to write your own map of life and then go and live it!Willa is living a good life. She&#8217;s got a good career and a great husband in Shawn to the point that they call themselves &#8216;Shilla&#8217; because they are so inseparable. Needless to say when Shawn hits her with the news that he&#8217;d like to take a two month separation from their marriage she is shocked and devastated. He proposes that they go on with their lives for these two months as though they were single. All I can say to that is one should be careful what they wish for&#8230;At first Willa is lost and only wants Shawn back but between and old boyfriend Theo and her best friend Vanessa, Willa&#8217;s outlook is slowing changing. Vanessa gets a job writing for the reality show Dare You! and manages to convince Willa to tackle a few dares of her own. She wants Willa to stop listening to the universe and accepting that things happen for a reason as her father has taught her and take some risks and maybe take a different path or two that could have the power to change her life.I felt connected to Willa from the first pages of this book. She&#8217;s vulnerable and uncertain in her journey in life just like so many of us are. Her husband Shawn needed a kick to his patoot but her brother Ollie was great. He is a yoga instructor to the stars but manages to get himself in hot water with his family trying to get him out of it. Her sister Raina had me laughing more than once as she popped her Xanax and then kept handing one over to Willa. They were just great characters who I really enjoyed spending some time with.I listened to the audiobook of The Theory of Opposites which is narrated by Christine Traister. I&#8217;ve never listened to her before but I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to again. She was fantastic with her different voices and all the emotions she put into each character. Just wonderful!I loved The Theory of Opposites and would recommend it in a heartbeat to readers who enjoy women&#8217;s fiction.

Each character's POV brings an entire new view on the story and gives the touch and personality of either Kate or Seth in the story. Once you read about them you'll feel like you've known them since a long time ago.Though it's a really fun and enjoyable read the ending was kind of rushed for my taste and all solved pretty quickly and I thought it could have ended more neatly with added drama and a more slower pace. Also, the  most important part, being magick and being nixies, it's not really explore in-depth which could have been a plus to the story.I recommend reading the book because it's really good.

Olivia comes to marry expecting to love only to find a man who cannot or will not love, who is a religious bigot AND an adulterer with the very type of women he supposedly hates.  You find he has a history of mental illness and there is a history of twisted sexual history to begin with, with the swan bed and an identical swan bed for a baby.

6103,"Holy freaking amaze-balls!!!!There is not a single thing that I could pick from this book to say I don't like because I loved it all. The jealousy, bitterness, sneaking, desire, love, text, conversations, hot and steamy moments and angst. I freaking love it all.How many people get to fall in,love with their hs crush when they were total,opposites, when the boy never acknowledged your existence and when your sister wants him??  Well one I know and that's Emma.Cole, oh have mercy!! That man is a walking sex bomb ready to detonate. He had me twisted like a freaking  pretzel. He was sweet, caring,unpredictable and a total caveman, which I absolutely love. The man had me swooning over and over again. I can't get enough of him.After 10 years their paths finally cross unexpectedly and the girl who once was invisible is the one who he can't stop thinking about. Cole is having some trouble getting Emma out of his head. He doesn't do relationships, he stays too busy at his job being a lawyer but Emma Carson is driving him mad. He wants and needs to see her.Emma has had a crush on Carson for years but always was unnoticed because of her sister Layla, who she thought had it all and after their unexpected run in, she is back to thinking of him again. Several dates per his request has her in fear of falling and having her heart broken. But she sure enjoys their time together.Cole wants ebay one to know of their relationship but Emma needs it to remain secret for fear of her family. Afraid they would be mad because they always had her sister pegged to be with Cole and she fears her sisters reaction.Let the craziness begin.

6112,"I have read and enjoyed all of Karin Slaughter's work, and ""Cop Town"" is right there with her best novels.  It takes place in Atlanta, Slaughter's hometown, in 1974.  This isn't a simple murder mystery, but concerns bigotry, abuse of power, corruption and the toxic atmosphere of the police force at that time.  The station has institutionalized blatant and aggressive bigotry: racism, misogyny, homophobia, religious discrimination, general hate and prejudice.  ""Cop Town"" depicts the despicable conditions and treatment that female officers have to deal with and overcome simply to do the job, survive, and take home a paycheck.As a rookie cop from wealthy background with a good education who's also a Jew, Maggie doesn't stand a chance of fitting in with the seasoned cops in the Atlanta PD.  She's way too different and represents everything most cops aren't.  Much of what she encounters at the station and on the job in the city is dirty, nasty, and ugly to the point of evil.  Maggie also has the baggage of compassion, largely absent in her fellow officers. Of course, Maggie's also tough and resourceful, otherwise, where's the story?When Maggie comes on the force, a series of execution-style murders of Atlanta cops is terrorizing the Department.  She is drawn into the hunt for the cop-killer, even though she is green.""Cop Town"" is a gripping story with unexpected twists and turns.  It's not pretty, but well executed and engaging reading.",5.0

Aaron was forced to kidnap Nicole and have her delivered to her grandparents in Greece.

Nicole feared she would end up like her mother if she were to lose Aaron. The emotional battle that these two were facing as a result was quite intense. The chemistry between these two was quite was quite intense, however, they had quite a number of obstacles to overcome before they could even think of being together.I loved Nicole, she is a brave and caring person. She was willing to risk all to protect Aaron and the other slaves.Of all the books in the series I found Taking Nicole to be quite emotional. It was filled with pain, sorrow, hatred, jealousy and humour, so when you begin to read this book be prepared to have all your emotions engaged.There were some suspenseful moments which had me on the edge of my seat. This was an enjoyable read from beginning to end.If you love paranormal stories that are short, sweet and spicy then I recommend this book as well as the others in the Vegas Mates series.",4.0

I felt too much explanation was given on the last book that wasn't even hinted on the previous ones. I do think a lot of it could have been utilized earlier in the story and not have to rush everything for the end.On e other hand, I did like how Four came down from the pedestal and joined the rest of the world, but thought extreme and unnecessary. Did appreciate the fights and doubts on their relationship, making it more real to me, but again I felt it was to extreme and too dull. It did continue building on the importance of forgiveness and self-confidence and therefore the second star, but after the hype on the first 2 books, I don't feel this one lived up them and that was a big disappointment.",2.0
6121,"When Rainey Bell hears that her father&#8217;s Vietnam Captain and long time friend has died in a hunting accident she has to go to the funeral, despite the forecast blizzard and leaving her wife and 2 year old triplets behind. Even without knowing it&#8217;s what her father would have expected she needs to go and pay her respects to a man who gave her comfort when she needed it most.After the funeral she wants to go home to Katie as quickly as possible but finds herself drawn back to the house at the request of the widow. Soon she if presented with a cold case file and the suggestion that Captain Wise&#8217;s death was not an accident.  Rainey is willing to take a look and use her behavioral analyst&#8217;s skills, but then she wants out &#8211; back to the child-free Valentine&#8217;s Day weekend she has planned.But as usual things never go smoothly when Rainey Blue Bell gets involved with a serial killer &#8211; even if the case is Colde.-------------This is the fourth Rainy Bell series. It stands alone, but will be much better appreciated as part of the series.Here RE Bradshaw takes Rainey and Katie down a slightly different track. Still a page turning thriller with a serial killer on the lose, this novel is gentler, more about the thought and analysis of a murder than the stark drama of the previous sadistic attacks on Rainey and Katie. Without giving any spoilers when Rainey&#8217;s life if threatened the sense is less whether she will survive and more how.As always Ms Bradshaw&#8217;s books are extremely well crafted and edited. The words flow, the characterization is brilliant and the dialogue both realistic and clever. It is the wit and elegance of the interactions that make these books stand out. As we have come to know Rainey and Katie the love and humor between them grows. Their adoration is palpable, their comfort together radiates, and their knowledge of each other leads to a tolerant and amused interaction. As additional pleasure we meet Danny again and have Molly and Leslie visit, a combination of friends that brings out the softer side of Rainey.It is this softer side Me Bradshaw explores. How Rainey&#8217;s thought process works is as much a part of this story as how the cold genius of the serial killer has managed to get away with the clever crimes. We watch Rainey use her mind to analyze the events from the past and survive the threats of the present. As much as anything though it is her love for her family that shines through, and although she doesn&#8217;t spend much time at home in this tale, the family is a constant presence and ultimately her driving force.RE Bradshaw creates wonderful people and intriguing plots. Rainey and Katie are two of the most loveable couples in print. It is always a joy to revisit old friends and this will not disappoint. Definitely another 5 star read and a great addition to the Rainey Bell family saga.",5.0

6128,"Rulers of Deception by Katie Jennings is the 3rd book in her Vassar Legacy series. Rulers of Deception continues the Vassar family saga story; with their elite Hotel chain, and the family we have come to care about.  I have reviewed the first two books, which if you need to get a refresher, you can find them under the Reviews tab (Barb&#8217;s Reviews &#8211; Katie Jennings).  In the last book I mentioned in my review that Jennings had a few more characters that she could write to keep this series going, and I am happy to say she did do another story.The Vassar family, after surviving a terrible scandal in the last book, have now successfully come all the way back.  They are merging their hotel with another hotel, and plans are underway to complete this new addition to the Vassar Hotel chain.  The main couples; Grant & Quinn, Linc & Lynetter, & Madison & Wyatt are all either married or close.  But when things go good, and you are on top, the danger rises from greed or jealousy that will rear its ugly head to try and destroy them again.The story actually starts off years before, when Wyatt won a lot of money while playing cards with a Columbian Drug lord.  But it was his friend Jimmy, who unbeknownst to Wyatt, secretly stole some cocaine.  They were able to escape, but no matter how many years pass, things can come back and haunt you.The Vassars are approached by a famous news reporter with a proposal to help promote them, and remove any previous lingering stains on their name.  But shortly thereafter, things begin to happen, with threats, pictures exposed to the press, and possible murder charges. What follows is an exciting story, with all the family working together to find out who is out to get them.Katie Jennings has created a number of villians, including the son of the hotel they are merging with; Wyatt&#8217;s friend Jimmy; the drug lord, and other surprising enemies. The family teams together to fight back, just as things spiral out of control.What I loved about this story was how strong Madison remains to hold the family and the hotel together, despite attacks on her also.  She is without a doubt the leader of the Vassars, even though Grant, and Linc are strong too.  I also enjoyed seeing their better halfs.I will not be giving spoilers, but only to say that Jennings has created a wonderful suspenseful story that flows so well. There were many twists and turns that had you guessing as to who was the mastermind behind the attacks on the Vassars.  Rulers of Deception has everything you would want in a story; suspense, betrayal, hatred, revenge and romance.  Katie Jennings has created wonderful characters in the Vassar family that we would love to continue to revisit.  If you have not read this series, you need to do so now.",5.0

6132,"This sort of book normally isn't my go-to book.  I usually favor paranormal/paranormal romance books.  Surprisingly, I really rather enjoyed this book!  It was funny, witty, cute, quick but not too quick of a read.  I caught myself laughing out loud a few times throughout the book.  Kate (the female lead) was a college graduate, unsure what to do with herself.  She finds a job to pay the bills and ends up staying with it for several years.  Throughout the book, we see her date/interact with a couple of guys and her friends.  I liked that Karen gave a little bit of the history to help us understand Kate and her friends.  Karen starts off the book with the present day in Kate's POV, then the next chapter 5 years previously, and each chapter after that slowly getting back to the setting of Chapter 1.  You learn where the term &#34;Modogamous&#34; comes from pretty early on and continually see the interaction between Kate and Drama, the dog (which I totally can relate to the interactions since I love and have 3 dogs of my own!).  Karen had me talking to my Kindle, technically to Mitch, and shaking my head at him and what he would do, or more accurately wouldn't do.  LOLThe only thing I didn't really care for was the POV stuff.  Karen would start the chapter in one perspective (which I'm totally fine with), then the next page or so she may go back to the main character's perspective.  At times it could get a little confusing, but since it didn't happen too often, it didn't deter from the book too badly.Overall, I would recommend this book to my friends.",4.0

6155,"Rating:  3 starsWhew, know going in that this is far far on the grittier and darker side of MC books.  I didn't read the prior books (1 and 1.5, both about Outlaw and Megs), but I did read the summaries and detailed reviews with spoilers so I had a good foundation in the back info.  If you do what I did and start with this one, I highly recommend some research into the summaries of the prior books.  This book picks right up after the bachelor party of book 1.5, with our current heroine Kendall in the bed of Johnnie.In this series every single character without exception seems to have undergone unbelievable abuse and tragedy.  Nobody seems to escape heartbreak in this, and it has been multiple generations.  So, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that their romance isn't really a romance much when I look at Kendall and Johnnie, but I held out hope.  Unfortunately, that wasn't realized and was a big problem with me for this book.  It is clear from beginning to end that Johnnie holds Megs in much higher regard than Kendall and probably always will.  Kendall comes off as someone Johnnie is simply stuck with, and he consistently compares her unfavorably to Megs.  That didn't leave me at all feeling this was a HEA or even a HFN despite the fact that that Johnnie and Kendall do leave the book &#34;together.&#34;  While I didn't find Kendall likable much, and was in fact shocked that a woman who was a lawyer would fall into such a mess in the first place, I would have enjoyed seeing her find something to hope for in her future.  I didn't see much of that at all, not the guy, not friends, not her sister, zip.The writing was interesting in the way of a soap opera or daytime talk show.  It kept me reading, which is not at all bad.  I like a darker book now and again, and this fits that bill.  I just was never convinced of the draw between the hero and heroine, even lust if not love.  I can stand a lot of darkness if I can see the passion between the couple.  Unfortunately, that wasn't present here.  The side characters and plots kept me reading more than the main couple.  I would probably pick up more from this series and hope for more time and intensity devoted to the main couple in the future, because the author did flesh out this complex world with so many details and personalities.I received a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest review.",3.0
6156,"A 4 rating is stretching it just a little. Story line was excellent, characters were well developed and tied together well. I thought the development of the relationship between Jack and (wow!?) I've already forgotten her name) was just a tad bit stretched. I also think Mr. Child's descriptions of damage done by the close up head shots of individuals was more like something you'd see in a Hollywood sensationalized movie. Real world wounds by small caliber hand guns punch a hole at best and do not remove faces. Also the Mag 10 shotgun does not spray fan shaped patterns until the shot particles reach quite a distance. Close up they send shot like an almost solid projectile. I enjoyed the book and even with the weaknesses I'll read more.",4.0

6166,"**Reviewed on behalf of Give Me Books**What? Those aren&#8217;t tears you see glistening in my eyes. Nope. Allergies. And those goose-bumps? They&#8217;re from the air conditioning being set too low. Yep. That&#8217;s right. Nothing to see here, folks. I didn&#8217;t just finish reading a book that made me well up like a baby with separation anxiety and smile like a giddy teenager on their first date. Orrrrrrrrrrrr, maybe I did. Alright, I did. Rex (the book and the character) made me cry &#8211; not ugly cry, for the record, it was more gentle than that &#8211; and smile and swoon and swear. And I loved every second of it.Rex Grayson thinks the stacked blonde that walks into his tattoo parlor is hot. Her desire to get ink that says Love Sucks isn&#8217;t the norm but then again, neither is what she makes him feel. Vanessa Hilliard has no faith in love. No hope for it in her life. All she wants is a tattoo. What she gets instead is a twisted, fucked-up bad boy that has the potential to change her life. They&#8217;ve both got pasts that are holding them back. And they&#8217;re both about to find out that the other is way more than they ever expected.I think I felt every moment of this book. Right from the beginning, but especially when Rex and Vanessa came face-to-face, I could tell that I was going to get attached, invested and emotional. Neither of them were perfect characters &#8211; they&#8217;re both holding on to shit that fills their past and clouds their future &#8211; but both of them were relatable in their own way. Their respective hurt made them real, human and flawed and I really enjoyed seeing them struggle to recognise and accept the changes that finding that someone can bring. I loved the structure of this book. The major moments weren&#8217;t all crowded at the end of the book, forcing and rushing the ending. Rex and Vanessa&#8217;s moments of realisation were well-spaced and well written &#8211; no sudden personality changes or insta-love.  But my very favourite moment, however, didn&#8217;t belong to Rex or Vanessa, but to a young woman getting a tattoo as a memorial to a lost loved one. Her sentiment, her words had tears streaming down my face. I re-read that passage several times, and highlighted it because it. was. perfect. So that explains the tears. But the smiles? There wasn&#8217;t one single moment that had me grinning &#8211; there were several throughout the book. Little passages that made me happy and hopeful. Sweet interactions that made me want to fall in love again. And an ending that made the romantic in me swoon. I haven&#8217;t read the first story in this series yet, but I will. I&#8217;ll just make sure to take some of that allergy medicine and bump the a/c temp first...Rex is the second book in the Finding Love series and can be read as a standalone. No cliffhanger.5 stars.",5.0
6167,"I loved this series! It's so fun to read the books in order because each story introduces the main character of the next one. I loved them. The last was my favorite. At first I judged the books by the, um, very unimpressive book covers and passed on them. I'm so glad I finally decided to give them a try. Lots of fun, so sweet! I really love the concept of one story leading to the next. I wish there was another series like this.

6179,"Okay, so I have been listening to a load of country music this past week. Thanks, for the most part, the topic of books I have recently been reading. And also thanks to the fact I just found out my phone has FM radio and country is what comes in best on it. YAY!! But mostly because of the topic of books I have been reading.A Dark & Stormy Knight is a wonderful wonderful story of cowboys and the women who love them...or believe that they don't in the case of Georgia McKnight, who left her bull riding husband years ago and has believed ever since she left him that it was the right thing to do. Her excuses? They were young and dumb, they thought love conquered all, etc. But, hey, whatever makes her sleep at night. It was these excuses that got her through all the visits to the McKnight ranch when dropping off her daughter with the girl's father for a select amount of time each summer. Then, however, she could just leave and come back when that time was over. But when a stroke takes out her mother and Georgia's sister Bethany calls her up to help out during the ENTIRE summer, she won't be able to hide behind her excuses. She will have to face the man she left in the dust.Sol McKnight was heartbroken the night Georgia left, and ever since, he has fought to keep her out of the hands of any man. So it seems like a dream come true when she has to stay the summer to help out her parents. Can he get her to stay for good, or will the past repeat itself by her running away from him again.I loved this book so much. It aggravated me to no end!!! But in a good way. Both characters are stubborn as mules and just too hard-headed to back down from each other. They goad one another just to get a reaction...AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK!! As the summer goes on, old feelings begin to come back, causing them to actually face what happened all those years ago.I must say that Georgia is a bit difficult, and that is putting things mildly. She is so quick to judge Sol on everything, and, to quote a character, &#34;he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't,&#34; but you can tell that she really does not want to face the truth. That what happened all those years ago could have been a HUGE mistake! However, I kind of like her this way. Yeah, it is aggravating at times to hear her judge Sol against other men and say that she would be better off with someone else, but that is what makes the story juicy. SO MUCH DRAMA!!!! I love it.I also love how every other character can see Sol and Georgia's true feelings for one another. But every time the subject is brought up, &#34;Oh no, it can't be...&#34; I find that so funny. But love is truly blind sometimes. And deaf, from all the yelling. And sore, from all the heated...well...conversations. *wink wink*In the end, a possible threat of impending marriage and a situation with an engagement ring may be the thing that decides the fate of Sol and Georgia.I noticed my review was getting a bit long, so I am just going to end by saying...READ THIS!!! It is a phenomenal book and just one of three in the McKnight series. More specifically, #3. Plus, there is even a short story about Sol and Georgia that takes place before this where Sol makes a plan to jeopardize yet another of Georgia's relationships. Definitely going to read that.I am officially a fan of Suzie Quint. Girl, you are AWESOME!!",5.0

6184,"Etched on Me is one young woman's journey from victim to survivor. Lesley Holloway was dealt a crap hand at life, her father repeatedly abused her while her mother knowingly turned a blind eye. When she finds the number for Children's Services she knows she can make her escape. Once she is able to leave, she had hoped her life would change for the better. Sadly, it doesn't. Her father was convicted and sentenced to prison, her mother wants nothing to do with her, and she's living on her own in a local hostel while commuting to a prestigious girl's school where she's on scholarship.During all of this, she begins to self-harm. One time at school she goes too far and nearly kills herself. This has sent in motion a harrowing two-year journey of hospital in-stay to help her get to the point where she can accept what's happened to her, and maybe be able to move on.After she graduates college, and years beyond self-harming, she finds out she's pregnant. Excited because it's something she never knew she wanted, Lesley goes to a midwife and her life is changed yet again. Social Services wants to take her unborn baby from her for fear of her past.Etched on Me is no easy read. There are times where I wanted to laugh, cry and just scream. There gets to be a point where you ask yourself, how much can one person endure. I found myself wanting to reach through the pages and just be that next person who was there for Lesley, someone to be apart of her support system.No topic was really taboo in this book either. It delves heavily into Lesley's abuse, mental stability and suicide attempts. If you do decide this is a book for you, make sure you have plenty of tissues. You'll need them.",4.0

He's always seemed rather laid back and his work very easy to read, so when I started reading instead of feeling like I was reading a story, it felt like I was being told one. Like Tom was just walking along side me telling me this amazing tale about classic writers and following your dreams, touching on topics that really hit hard in the writing world, as well as the rest of the world. We all go through similar moments like the ones in this novel, we all need a little inspiration, we've all been a little desperate, and decided to keep going, but it was the way Tom told the story that gave it magic.

6200,"When I was seeking more information about how to grow in my Christian life over 30 years ago, one of the first reference books that was recommended was Unger's &#34;The New Unger's Bible Dictionary&#34;. It was/is an excellent resource for understanding the tenets and history of the Bible. So when I saw this book, also by Dr. Unger, as a Kindle freeby one day I jumped on it. It is well worth the cost of buying it if you missed the free offer.Dr. Unger wrote this material in 1945 as a dissertation and partial requirement for the degree of Doctor of Theology. Even though we don't think of 1945 as being &#34;modern&#34; the ways of Satan to confuse, trap, and derail the Christian life are as old as humanity and what was true then is true now. I'm very grateful for the Kindle built in dictionary because I had to use it frequently to get the whole meaning of what was being said. The language is very intellectual but I don't even have a college degree and I can understand what he is saying.It helps to have a good background in the Bible because many scripture references are used. Also, Dr. Unger tells it like it is--no politically correct allowances are given for questionable activities. He explains how the workers of Satan use divination, astrology, mediumship, speaking to the dead, and all other forms of occult practices to lead people into sin and away from the truth of God's authority.The first few chapters are a little dry and seem to be the most outdated, expecially since we don't often refer to people of other religions as &#34;heathens&#34; any more. But that was common to the time of the writing and the truths have not changed, just the words we use to describe them. By the time the author gets to chapters 6 and beyond it starts to get really interesting. Have you ever wondered how magic could be sinful? After all, pulling a scarf out of a sleve seems pretty innocent. Well, the author explains what about magic is sinful and why. I love the TV shows about people that talk to the dead and give assurance to loved ones that all is well &#34;on the other side&#34;. Well, that is called necromancy and Dr. Unger explains why that is deceitful as well. What about reading the future from looking at a dead animals liver? That is called augury and it is still done in parts of the world. Did you know one way of telling the future was performed by people who slept in empty graves to get messages from their ancestors? Me neither! I have heard of people sitting under pyramids to channel &#34;energy&#34;. I wonder if that would qualify as something similar?We live in such a babylonian society and so much of what we commonly see is linked to superstition and demonology it is frightening. Do you wear a lucky medallion around your neck? In a series of fun books I just finished and gave 5 star reviews to, the main character wears an &#34;eye of Horas&#34; charm on a chain around her neck and rubs it when she gets frightened. Totems like that are a form of animism (look that up in your dictionary).The truth of God is so simple but we always want more; more knowledge, more power. God wants to be the source of our strength and will not stand for letting us be lead into the errors of temptation. But that will not stop Satan from trying. Dr, Unger says periods of demon activity come and go just like Christain religious revivals. I think we are in a period of increased demon activity and we need to know how to recognise it so we won't be lead astray. Get out your Bible and dictionary and dig in--there is a lot to digest here.",5.0

The cover is what drew me in (hey, who doesn&#8217;t' like a sexy man without his shirt?), but the book itself didn't disappoint! You're sucked in from the beginning, taken on a ride of danger and sex. Oh the sex, I wish I had my own Angel at home to help me out with that ;).Eve is coming to Australia for her best friends wedding, someone she hasn&#8217;t seen in over 6 years. She&#8217;s so excited to see her friend, but that all changes in the blink of an eye and she witnesses something that puts her life and others in danger. Now that she has the protection of her &#8220;foster&#8221; father Elvis&#8217; MC to keep her safe, her vacation plans total change. But what happens next, ruins any happy feeling she had coming down to see her friend.Angel &#8220;aka Gabe&#8221; is one sexy beast. He&#8217;s the VP of the MC that is helping protect Eve. However, he has this instant attraction to her that he tries so hard to fight. Eve&#8217;s unattainable, she&#8217;s Elvis daughter, and he just can&#8217;t go there. Besides, he is a love them and leave them type of guy, no matter how great the sex it. He has no interest commitment, but after he starts to spend more time with Eve he begins to change his mind.After a tragic incident, the MC pulls together and makes a plan, lives may end because of the plan they have come up with, but Angel is determined to keep his MC, as well as Eve, safe. But what will he do after everything is done?As time creeps up and it&#8217;s almost time for Eve to go back home, Eve and Angel and left wondering what is going to happen between them. Do they finally admit to each other how they feel? Or does Eve go back home and never know how their lives could have changed if she stayed?This book ends with a huge cliff hanger.

6208,"I bought this book because of the high reviews and all the hype it gave this book. To be honest I really didn't enjoy this book much. I'm not new to drawing so pages 1 to 331 was not at all interesting to me. In my opinion, it felt like learning how to draw from a young student who is still learning how to draw himself/herself. I was expecting to get 331 pages of information from an actual professional manga artist or from a professor of art who knows a lot about manga but I was disappointed.Pages 332 to 377 was ok. It explained how to scan a drawing correctly, color a drawing with PhotoShop, add shadows, add photographs to the illustration, color a sketch, use different paint modes, create fillers/special effects/textures/patterns, insert and edit blocks of type. This was the only part of the book that was worth reading.I think the title ""The Monster Book of Manga: Draw Like the Experts"" is really miss leading. After reading and studying this book I really don't think anyone will be drawing like the experts anytime soon. I really don't consider any of the artwork in this book to be at an expert level. In my opinion, the artist who created this book is just an average artist and is not expert artist himself/herself.Even though I did not enjoy this book, I am still giving this a 5 star rating because I know other people will enjoy this book more than I did. I would recommend this book to teens and adult but not kids because this does contain some nudity. This book isn't for everyone. Hopefully this book is made for you and if you choose to purchase this book, it somehow helps you draw like the experts.",5.0

6216,"I first discovered Ross Matthews on Chelsea Lately *(call me a late bloomer).  From the first moment I saw him, I was enamored with his infectious personality and humorous quips.  If you've ever seen a Ross Matthews segment on Leno or Chelsea Lately, I can literally hear him reading his book to me.  He writes in the same dialogue in which he speaks, which makes the book.  I really enjoyed this book, it kept me laughing and was a quick read.  Ross Matthews- if you ever read this, I'd love to be YOUR best friend! :)",5.0

6219,"The Avatar of Calderia reminded me why its important to read comments from the author at the beginning of a book.  Creative thinkers will always get inspiration from those who came before them.  For example, if you watch a Quentin Tarantino movie you see the elements of spaghetti westerns, 70&#8242;s era blaxploitation films, Anime, and the golden age of Hollywood.  To watch a Tarantino film and not acknowledge the homage to his craft is missing a significant element of the film as presented.At the beginning of The Avatar of Calderia the writer introduces the reader to this work as a tribute to his favor genres.  Noting that the familiarity in elements of the story are deliberate.  This gives the reader and idea of what to expect.  Which is to say, when you are reading and can relate this book to stories past, you are understanding the book as it was meant to be.  As I read The Avatar of Calderia I was able to delight in the authors love of classic science fiction and fantasy.  I was also pleased, when skimming the other reviews posted for this book, to see that it had not been rated low due its classic inspiration.The story begins with the King of Kal`Dathia preparing to awaken the great Rak`koth.  What he believes to be the savior of his people, turns out to be one of the most evil sorcerers the world has ever known (always be weary of history&#8230;for you never know whose perspective you are hearing it from).  Upon his freedom he instantly wrecks havoc on the surrounding lands.  Luckily, the return of the evil Rak`koth had been foreseen by the Gods, who since his defeat nearly eight centuries ago have gifted a mortal in each generation with special gifts to confront him.  The Prince of the Kingdom of Calderia, Prince Killian, holds such gift.  But he will have to unite longtime enemies if he is to be successful in his quest.The character development and storytelling is good.  While I don&#8217;t think this story will appeal to all, I would definitely recommend it to any lovers of classic science fiction and fantasy.  Enjoy this fast-paced, fun read as a celebration and nod to the stories that came before it!",5.0
6220,"Lovers of paranormal romance and an enthralling story would love D'Arc' Tales of Were/Redstone Clan series. With each successive book, we see the warriors of good matching steadily toward the final showdown with evil--in the form of Elspeth and her apostles, the Venifucus. The Redstones, as one of the most influential clans in North America, have found themselves at the epicenter of the battle. As each brother battles evil and finds their mate, the intensity of the stories increase as well. And in all honesty, Bobcat was my most favorite, which is saying something since I loved all the stories so far, and it blew me away. I adored Bob! He was an alpha's Alpha but totally recognized, accepted and appreciated Serena's need to stand on her own two feet. D'Arc expertly showed Serena's metamorphysis from timid to fierce. Although she was fearful of the situations surrounding her and Bob, she was not afraid. The integration of characters from previous stories was fluid and organic and story continuity was brilliant. Everything in this story just worked and worked well for me. I can't wait to see who D'Arc hooks Matt up with.",5.0

6226,"I loved this story.  Although I did not like the premise of the book, I took a chance and bought it, in the hope (by the book description) that this time the hero would be more invested into her, than the other way around, as is usually the case in most romance stories.  I mean a heroine who is very willing to be a mistress, and grovel for the honor, and a hero who allows himself to be humiliated by his romantic rival, even if he is the king (after all this is not real life), is not my idea of a great couple.  And  yet I am so glad I did buy this book..  For starters:  the hero is instantly in lust, he is the one who wants the relationship, soon is very devoted to his lady, and most importantly for me, he falls in love first.  For a wonderful, refreshing change he is the one who is insecure and anxious to win her love.  He is the one who is totally distracted by his desire for her.Yes, the heroine was not always very nice (an understatement).  Yet I will take a self centered heroine, any time, over the usual one.  The one who spends most of the story musing of how desperately she loves the hero and lamenting that he does not love her in return.  After all, very few care when the hero is cruel, selfish, and treats her dismally, refusing to fall in love.  Yet there is so much outrage, when a heroine exhibits these same traits.  Talk about a double standard!  I also appreciated that a heroine who is supposed to be already in love, does not fall out of love, upon meeting the hero, and is  instantly smitten with this new man..In conclusion, the book is not for everyone, but for me it was perfect.",5.0

6229,"James, the Duke of Candover is the Premier duke of the realm; also one of the wealthiest; handsomest; and it must be said the biggest stick in the mud ever!  Duty, duty, duty! At the deathbed of his beloved god-father, more father to him than his own, he was asked to make sure his god-father&#8217;s beloved only daughter, now a Duchess in her own right would be seen to and protected.  To be sure, she should marry appropriately -  a man no more than a few years older than she, so that she would never have to care for an aged old man.Since she was a child, Isabelle Tremont, the Duchess of March has always been in love with the Duke of Candover.  During her father&#8217;s last days, Candover had brought great peace and solace to her father.  Isabelle was more than grateful for his devotion to her father in his last days, which was why when Prinny made it known that he wanted his Entourage of unwed dukes and yes, even Isabelle, an unwed Duchess to go forth and propagate (so to speak) she would do as she was bid!  Actually, Prinny was sure that Isabelle and James would make a splendid match!  However, pride, duty, and a death-bed promise would keep James apart from the one woman he could not have  &#8211; who is the only one who he knew he would ever truly love.***  The one thing I am so sorry for after reading THE ONCE AND FUTURE DUCHESS, is that it is the last book of the Entourage series.  Obviously, from reading book #4, I can  only surmise how much enjoyment I have missed by not having discovered this series long before the last book.  Truly, there are no excuses, as I am fully aware of Ms. Nash&#8217;s excellence in telling a historical tale, complete with fascinating characters, terrific plots, and lovely sensualness.Isabelle, was such a delight - a young woman who grew up knowing her duty, even though she was not the male heir that would have made her parents so much happier.  She knew, yes she was loved, but knew she could never measure up to a male heir.  Mindful of that, Isabelle was determined to do her utmost to do herself proud in running the estates she was now responsible for.  No time for fun and games, that most young ladies born of good ton were able to indulge in.  No, it would be up to her to continue her line and in that regard she was ready to wed and provide the needed heir.  Having a somewhat clandestine pen-pal relationship with Prinny, Ms. Nash left the reader with some interesting and humorous reading as Isabelle and Prinny combined their efforts in hoping to shackle James into marital bliss.Unfortunately, for Isabelle, her hero and best friend James, Duke of Candover, whom she knew cared for her turned her down flat when she approached him for a marriage of convenience.  Turning the tables on him, Isabelle then enlisted James to help her weed out the undesirables on her list of possible suitors and try as he might to stay unbiased, the thought of Isabelle in another&#8217;s embrace was not easy to swallow.Bottom Line:  This book was above all, a very fun read, with some extremely interesting long held secrets revealed. My only wish is that I started this wonderful series from the beginning &#8211; and I may just go out and pick up this backlist as it was truly that good!Marilyn Rondeau, [...]",4.0

6231,"ARC provided by Bolero Books via NetGalley for an honest review.First I want to say that this book intrigued me because it is about one of my favorite subjects &#8211; DANCE.  I love dance in any form, from folk dancing, ballroom, line dancing, krump &#8211; heck, name it and I love it.  If it is set to music and it makes your body want to get up and move, get lost in the rhythm and become a different person for 5 to 10 minutes, count me in!I enjoyed the premise of this book, I recognized some of the fictional characters that the author based her story on, even down to their specialty.  I&#8217;ve been a Dancing with the Stars fan and view since season 1 and I have my favorite Pros &#8211; one of which is a very good friend of the author, Cheryl Burke.  I&#8217;ve also read Cheryl&#8217;s book, Dancing Lessons, which I recommend if you are a DWTS fan.The author herself is a &#8220;recovering&#8221; dance competition dancer herself with a degree in English Lit.  I Googled her Bio before I started writing my review to see what her dance background was because the tone of the book did have the feel of someone that has been involved in the dance world.  I was just surprised that she didn&#8217;t include more history or technical aspects of ballroom into the book.  It could have been woven into the story very easily to teach those out there that have a moderate interest a little bit more about the world of ballroom and what EXACTLY judges are looking for when they score.I can understand that the dance world can be a very cut throat world &#8211; but I honestly think at the end of the day, the dancers do treat each other as family.  Face it, they are in a position that not many people can understand the world that they live in day by day.  In each family you are going to have your fights, yelling matches and making up &#8211; it&#8217;s how the world goes round, folks.Only thing I really didn&#8217;t like about the book and why it got a 4 star instead of a 5, is because the story was disjointed.  The way the author set the chapters up, it felt like there were big pieces of the story missing in between.  I did enjoy the Interludes, where the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of each dance is described &#8211; I thought that was a wonderful touch.  I&#8217;m also used to switching between characters from chapter to chapter when reading a book, but with this book, I felt that the writing was a little stiff and left out a whole piece of the picture.  Instead of getting a full story, I felt like I was only getting snap shots, little peeks into their life &#8211; so it left me feeling like I was reading Cliff Notes instead of an actual novel.All and all I did enjoy the book and do recommend it for anyone that is a Dancing with the Stars fan.",4.0
6232,"I always enjoy Grisham's stories, in fact that is why I ordered the book.

It is about bad behaviour when you are so desperate to find some sanity in life.  It is about an uneasy road to love when it is the last thing you think you need.  It was hot and steamy but that is not what won me over because the intensity is there because of the crossroad both people have reached and depending on what life throws at you this can come at any age.

6241,"What I loved:Rebecca DeMarino is a talented writer. She was able to make me love and hate the characters and how she writes with her flow and descriptions, I was able to picture everything.I love the time period and marriages of convenience and the Puritan history.What I didn't like:First of all, I don't know if I was frustrated with how much of the book description gives away or how slow the book was. But it takes almost one-third of the book to get to what we already know from the book description.It was hard to follow the time periods with skipping years at a time.I disliked the 'hero' Barnabas and don't consider him one at all and his one son and how they treated Mary.I did to like how Barnabas was a &#34;holier than thou- God talk&#34; guy who was mean and selfish and the very picture of one of the worst hypocrites. I wanted to throw my book when he had a talk with Mary of never physically hitting her like he was so great for that even though I consider his treatment of her very emotionally abusive.Final thoughts:I find it too hard to love a book, no matter how talented the author and the writing when I hate one or more of the main characters and everything they do throughout the book. So, while I didn't like this book, I am sure others will be able to latch onto the writing and like it and we all have different opinions of people characteristics and what makes a 'hero', so some will love this book but I wrote my honest opinion.I personally rate this book 2.5 out of 5 stars as I didn't care for it, the writing itself is great, but the story and characters I didn't like.I received this book from Revell for my honest review, which I have given.",2.0

6248,"This is a fantastic book to read now, since it mirrors a lot of what is going on in the Obama Administration in the current day. Obama has been accused of being a communist and a socialist, and certainly there is plenty to support those accusations; but it seems that Nixon was indeed a leader that Obama has studied well too. His version of 21st Century fascism is much worse than anything Nixon pulled frankly.Hersh takes us through the past and the years of Nixon and Watergate. It should be noted that Hersh has an ax to grind, is a liberal thinker and write, and his bias is strong throughout the book. Still, the facts--very carefully annotated by the author--leave no doubt that Nixon and Kissinger both were despicable. I am a conservative and lifelong Republican, but I winced many times over as I read things I never know and/or didn't believe when I heard them years ago. The petty selfishness of educated grown men in positions of power only proves the adages that 'power corrupts' and 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.' It seems a total shame that in the 40+ years since these events took place, we Americans have learned little about the corruption and power politics by both parties, and reinforces my belief that TERM LIMITS for ALL elected officials is an absolute if we are to save our republic from ruin by greedy, mean spirited and over bearing fuss pots and LIARS.

With such a short length, events moved rather quickly and would have benefited from a deeper, more thoughtful development.

It gave me so many mixed feelings that I ended up giving it four stars when I originally wanted to give it three stars.I wish I could say the overall story was boring and nothing interesting seemed to happen, but I can't. At first you even think that the story never goes forward and all you read is what's going on with the world. It's a world in war and a boy is telling you what he sees and boy, that is annoying. But then one completely unexpected event happens. And the another. And another. And another. And another. That's when you realize that you're halfway through the book and you're... actually enjoying what's going on. Boy, you'll soon notice that you're actually curious to know what's about to happen, even if the story seems to get stuck in the description of the scenarios.Next, I wanted to say that the characters are plain and not well developed. But then, I started to like the briefness and subtlety of their actions and words. They're not ones to talk too much, but they're actually very easy to like. They are somewhat predictable, yet there is &#34;something&#34; in them that makes you like them, be it Ragnar's fatherly words or Brida's wise-ass replies. After a while, even Uhtred's navety started to look kinda charming.This is a confusing book. So hard and, at the same time, so easy to like.

6272,"I got this when it was offered for free a while back, and just finished reading it. It's an autobiography of a girl whose mother suffered from anorexia (though I don't think she explicitly said so), and the problems her mother's illness caused her family.Though it starts off with really lovely phrasing and style, it eventually becomes repetitive. Timelines become somewhat confused as Ms. Joseph incorporates flashbacks abruptly into the modern narrative. Though its tagline suggests she will explore her mother's childhood as well as her own, there is very little mention of the unfortunate circumstances of her mother's girlhood (sent to England to avoid Hitler's march across Europe).The raw emotions come through, but it also seems Ms. Joseph would benefit from therapy as she harbors so much guilt for her mother and father's problems, when clearly she is not to blame. By the end of the book, I wanted to shake Ms. Joseph and tell her just that, as she dwells on her inner demons.I hope writing the book was cathartic for her. It is an interesting enough read, but as a memoir in need of editing and not a full-fledged autobiography.",3.0

I've been a fan of Revert's for some time, ever since reading his debut collection, A MILLION VERSIONS OF RIGHT, Even there, I knew I was watching something special.

His first novel, THE TUMOURS MADE ME INTERESTING, only served to drive the point home, as it was one of the most entertaining and devastating books I'd read in years. Watching Revert's work, it's clear that he's been evolving and only getting better. His vision has become more concise, stripping away the juvenile tactics of his earlier works while still retaining the absurd, and building on the crushing emotional weight his work often carries.This progress has stemmed into something incredible, and has yielded glorious fruit. Revert's latest novel, BASAL GANGLIA, is possibly the best book I read in 2013. To try and describe the impact it book had on me would be impossible. It had a huge effect on me, not just as a writer but as a human person. I cannot recommend this book enough. There is a quiet, patient beauty to BASAL GANGLIA that I hadn't encountered for some time. The basic premise is still rather absurd (a couple exist within a massive pillow fort built in the image of the human brain), but here the emotional human core really shines. Each sentence feels carefully constructed, and the result is a slow, rewarding trek that studies the nature of relationships and, ultimately, the self.With BASAL GANGLIA, Revert has secured his place as one of the best writers going. In a better world, BASAL GANGLIA would top the bestseller lists. This is truly a book that needs to be read.",5.0

6279,"Laline Paull has achieved something quite remarkable in this tale set in a hive where all the characters are bees and other insects: she has created a convincing world that is original and striking and utterly original.We follow the adventures of Flora 717, a sanitation worker bee and member of the lowest caste in the colony but one with special abilities that allow her to move well beyond her lowly station in life. Through her eyes, her nose and her antennae, we explore every corner of the hive through the cycle of a year full of drama.Of course, this story is not exactly about bees. These bees think and speak, plot, hope, love and die as sentient beings. But they are not exactly humans either. I didn't read this as an allegory on fascism or totalitarianism; I didn't see it as a thinly-disguised dystopia warning us of the dangers of conformity. It is not &#34;Brave New World&#34; or &#34;1984.&#34; This is really about bees as interpreted through human eyes in human terms. That's what makes it so interesting.Flora, unlike her kin, can speak. She gets to explore the hive and through her eyes we see the breeding grounds where the queen's eggs mature and hatch. She becomes a forager, seeking out nectar, which brings her into contact with natural enemies of the bees - nasty wasps, filthy flies, foraging crows and evil scheming spiders. She saves the hive by repelling an attack by a massive wasp and is rewarded by a private audience with the Queen. She experiences a series of mystical trances that teach her, and us, about the history and future of her kind.We also meet the drones - spoiled, arrogant, useless creatures, some of whom take on individual characteristics. We meet the Sage priestesses who enforce the religious tenets of the hive based on the mantra, &#34;Accept, Obey, Serve&#34; and the credo, &#34;Only the Queen may breed.&#34;  Their rule is backed up the the storm troopers of the hive who exercise swift and certain justice to enforce conformity and root out deformity.There is drama aplenty here. The slaughter of the drones, the coming of winter and the various battles Flora engages in, all vividly described. The climax comes when the Queen loses her vitality and is swiftly deposed and disposed off in a scene that could have come out of Byzantine history. And then a struggle ensues for the succession culminating in a true battle royal.This is a tremendous debut by a gifted author who has brought into being her own fully-imagined world. Quite an achievement.",5.0

Being from New Orleans, I think it was better this time than before for many reasons.  It took me back to a New Orleans that only exists in memories.  The old Canal Street of that time, D. H. Holmes department store where Ignatius is &#34;waitin' for his momma,&#34; Werleins music store where he purchases a string for his lute, Woolworth's (and yes, some locals did refer to it as Woolsworth) as we so eloquently put it down here, 'ain't dere no more.'  As I made my way through the pages, I could feel the sights and sounds of a New Orleans long gone.  The dialect was spot on, and there is lots of humor throughout the story.

6284,"In this very original book, the author draws convincing parallels between four cities that are far apart, both geographically and culturally: Saint Petersburg, Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai.The quantity and quality of research is remarkable, a wide range of enlightening details being provided.  Though some may judge certain sentences to be intricately constructed, the work is well written and well organized. Each chapter deals with a phase of development in a single city.  Chapters are placed chronologically so that the reader lively moves from one city to the next as he plunges ahead.Apart from changing its odd title, the only improvement that could be made to this work is with regards to illustrations.  As things are, black and white maps are provided at the beginning of the book locating the four cities and giving some level of detail for each and a few black and white photos are inserted here and there. So much more pertinent information could be conveyed with an abundance of well positioned colour photos and maps!Still, this fascinating book provides a unique point of view on the history of the past three centuries and is warmly recommended to all interested in the evolution of cities.",4.0
6285,"As mind-blowing as the events of 9/11 were to take in, in real time, it is equally mind-blowing to read of them today, especially in such minute detail.  Dwyer and Flynn have performed an important service in presenting a cross-section of the many thousands of personal stories that unfolded in the towers from the moment the first one was struck till the moment it fell.  It is unbelievable to think that so much death and destruction was wrought in so brief a time span.  102 minutes.  Less time than it took me to read this fast-paced and riveting book.  102 minutes places the reader in both towers, on the floors and in the elevators, and makes palpable the chaos, fear, and uncertainty of that terrible morning in lower Manhattan.  In addition to the human story it tells, 102 Minutes also elucidates the many complicating factors -- ineffective communication technology, bad building practices, etc. -- that exacerbated an already horrific tragedy.  102 minutes is a harrowing and essential read.",5.0

If I may say: asking God once only for anything and never again for the same thing--because it was asked in faith and now God is expected to respond favorably, praying only once for anything--totally disallows the spirit of the Old Testament context and idea of prayer. God wants us to ramble on, to turn our hearts lose on Him, to repeat ourselves in our pain or hurt because it is a natural thing to do. God wants to be wanted!So, a grace concept that ends communion on any level at Salvation instead of having it BEGIN there, is not a true understanding of grace.Dr. Brown adds the argument and the Scripture.",4.0

When she talked about the food or the lights or the fear, it was real, you could identify with the characters; they live next door, your relatives, and the people you've seen before but only to nod hello.

I found it too predictable, and there are lots of unnecessary scenes that slowed the story down. Too much scripture for one thing. I liked Lilly; she's a strong woman. The thing that really bothered me and seemed so out of character for Lilly was her hot-over-heels love for Paul. But then--suddenly--without enough story or explanation, she's google-eyed over Tern after looking into his eyes. I thought maybe I'd accidentally jumped ahead too far in my Kindle, so I went back. But no I hadn't. And I was disappointed in the ending. Again, the crucial part of the story was rushed. Too much of what the characters wore, etc. I would've liked more meat of the story itself.

Caroline has no family and has left her friends behind and Sebastian is living his surfer dreams even though its against his fathers wishes.

These books will have your emotions rolling all over the place and you will cry as well as laugh as we follow their story.In The Education of Sebastian  we watch a women who knows its wrong to love a boy try and hide her feelings and we watch a boy who can see no wrong in his feelings and the love he feels for her.&#8220;I want you, Caro. I want to make love to you. I want to make love to you forever.  My breath caught in my throat.I want that, too.

Out of the three characters - one I didn't like at all, one I had no connection with and only one did I feel showed any kind of 'character' or strength.The story is pretty much run of the mill but there are big gaps left where you as a reader have no knowledge.  Admittedly, in the first example, Alice has no idea why her mother is sending her to high school for the first time either.  Now the gaps may be filled in future books but it is a fine line to draw between leaving the reader hanging on or just plain mystified.There is a lot of insta- love between the characters and Kai strops like a pro!  Talk about teenage tantrum.  I have to say as well, only a small point, but this is the first vampire book I have ever read where a vampire eats nothing but food!  Alice thinks about drinking blood but that's it.  The closest you get to it is when Kai throws another strop and goes off by himself.This book has potential but needs tightening up a fair bit.http://archaeolibrarianologist.blogspot.de/2014/03/shelter-blood-haze-1-by-tara-shuler.html",3.0
6338,"Throughout the whole book there was a very pensive and reflective tone that kept building.  Kind of like that hurricane that was bearing down on them.  You were pretty sure something unpleasant was headed your way.  You could see it in the distance but weren't sure how bad it was going to be until it reached you.  And no matter how well provisioned or prepared you are for the impact when it does hit, you either have to stand strong with your friends or fall apart like a boat moored to the shore.This story wasn't about the mystery of who killed John Trotter or buried treasure.  It was about Sarah Booth Delaney&#65279; finding her strength.  It was about SBD knowing no matter what happens, her friends (and family - whether dead or alive) will always be there for her.  It was about events in the past impacting the present and future.  It was about life going on in spite of heart breaking loss.",5.0

6343,"I wanted to like this series after so many kids had requested it for our library, but sadly I can not recommend this at all for our school library.  And the main reason is : a 17 year old has sex with a teacher and nothing bad happens.  Other issues are a whole race of people subjugated and enslaved for the pleasure and protection of another &#34;higher race&#34;. Repeated scenes of underage drug use and drinking, young girls being inpregnated and it being taken as normal. And a vampire princess destined to rule them through a &#34;democratic monarchy&#34; ( I mistrust any system that states it has an absolute ruler that is elected). There were moments of interest and the world itself has depth, and the characters were tolerable. but I just could not get beyond there being no consequences to the idiotic behavior of almost every character in the books.If Ms. Mead had just set her stories in College, most of my issues go away.  It still would be an uneven story with serious character issues, but if everyone is an adult, then it is just stupid behavior not criminal.  There are better teen romances out there.  There are better vampire novels out there (and no twilight is not one of them, a 100 year old stalker man in love with a teenager is not ok just because he looks young.). Save your money for books that have more going for them than a bad guy with an accent and a leather jacket who could not keep it in his pants.",1.0

Some other reviewers found Jim an unlikeable character, and I am not sure why - because he had character flaws that most of us carry? I guess that makes Heller a good writer, no?

The constant switching between high school manipulations, over worry about appearance given the situations and trying to be a grown up drained my energy as much as Presley's. I would hope that most young women of Presley's age are more mature than Presley was portrayed.

Although at times I felt it was a bit over-clich&eacute;d and included a few too many metaphors, I couldn't wait each day to be able to pick it up again and spend whatever time I had becoming a friend with the two families and with Isaac, a friend to both Gus and Hazel Grace. I felt I was hearing their conversations versus reading about them and I actually wanted to participate with these children who in many ways were much older souls than I.  I laughed with them, raged with them, cried with them, and, in the end, celebrated them.

6365,"This started out a little rocky, got interesting, and ended in sweetness.  I didn&#8217;t know how I felt about Dante in the beginning, and Lacey&#8217;s fangirl persona was a little obnoxious to me frankly.  She waffles frequently between that persona and her professional mask.  While part of the story, it made me want to smack her.  Plus, she&#8217;s much more comfortable with his lifestyle than I would be.  I&#8217;d be pretty miffed in some of the situations that she just brushes off.Beyond that, it gets compelling very quickly and even though it&#8217;s pretty predictable, it&#8217;s a fun story with characters that are likeable in the end if not at first.  I was taken along for the ride with Lacey and ended up appreciating Dante for all his layers.  There&#8217;s room for more books with some of these characters, but there&#8217;s nothing that suggests it will be a series or needs to be.

There is no reason you should waste your time and money on a book like this when you can go buy almost anything other than Dan Slott written Spider-Man and it will be better. Go read anything from the 1990's-2006. Go read Brian M. Benis's Ulimate Spider-Man. Go read Stan Lee/Steve Dikto stuff. Go read The Death of Gwen Stacy. Go read Todd McFarlane's stuff. At least that was all drawn really well. Go read anything, but this garbage. Also why should we get emotionally invested in this new girl, Carlie Cooper? Marvel has already stated that Peter would never get married again. So we know eventually the relationship with this character will fail. What's the point in having a character that can never move forward? I'll say this at least, I can see why a kid might get a kick from reading it.

The journey of Jason and kale from the very first book keeps you on the edge of your seats. Their fight for their love against all odds is very touching. The final book in this trilogy is the perfect ending in the lives that had been filled with trials and tribulations that would have tested a normal human. We see Kale's strength and his love shine through, his ability to forgive those that have wronged him in the past and his unquestionable devotion to Jason. We see Jason face some personal tragedies and self realisation of all that he thought was, wasn't. And he knows that he'll be okay because he has the very best man in the world by his side(KALE). Their quest to find closure and put the past to rest was a difficult one that they both had to undertake but it was well worth it in the end.

6393,"Isabel Allende has a tremendous reputation, and I was excited to see that her latest novel was genre: a thriller.  However, her literary roots are obvious.  The crimes and their investigation tend to take a background to character vignettes and digressions.At first, I thought that RIPPER would focus on teenage Amanda and her leadership of a group of kids (and her grandfather) determined to research true crimes.  But the book quickly turns its focus to her mother, Indiana, and Indiana's various loves, customers/patients, and friends.  Although Indiana seems entirely peripheral to the crimes, it doesn't take a great detective to realize she'll be central at the end.  (It's that fact that gave away who the killer was for me, although there was a brief moment where I doubted my own guess.)Thus, RIPPER took awhile to capture my attention.  There was much flipping between a large cast, and I didn't find Indiana all that compelling.  She's a touch too beloved by every other character.  However, I read it while waiting for car repairs, which forced me to push through and eventually fall into the rhythm of the novel.I particularly liked the setting.  RIPPER is set in San Francisco and makes good use of the city's various neighborhoods, social classes, gay friendliness, and reputation for hippie-ness.  Also, the various characters seemed to connect in natural ways, although it took awhile to put together who knew who and how.  To be fair, that seemed to be Allende's design.I think that RIPPER has a bit too much literary fiction in its blood to be a truly compelling thriller.  The same details about the crimes are endlessly rehashed, and since the police characters aren't the focus, there's rarely an actual scene with someone discovering a new clue, just reporting it.  I must admit, I'd also rather read a novel about ambitious, morbid Amanda than healing, maternal-except-with-her-daughter Indiana.  It was fun to read a thriller that didn't pay much attention to the conventions of its genre.  I enjoyed RIPPER by the end, but think I'd've given up if I had more with me to read.",3.0

6398,"Ester De Waal is an Anglican lay woman, a historian who studied and taught at Cambridge. Her specialties are Celtic Christianity in general, and Benedictine spirituality. The two fields, of course, fit together quite naturally. As this book makes very clear, Celtic Christianity owes very much of its development to two great traditions. The Celtic half of it covers, quite literally, the westernmost peoples of Europe, although Rome and even later London might argue that the Celtic peoples were not Western Europeans at all. (De Waal does not mention it, but just a couple of centuries ago some English writers were portraying the Irish in particular as barely human, and sometimes the Scots not much better.) For those who come to this book not knowing much about the Celts, this book will introduce them to a much wider cast of characters than they might expect. Although the individuals and the cultural creations that De Waal writes about here are most Irish, Scots, and Welsh, she acknowledges that there were other peoples who contributed to Celtic Christianity, including peoples living in the areas that we know today as Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. Reading this book, one will learn a bit about the lives of the Celtic peoples from the earliest days of Christianity in the British Isles through the nineteenth century, when many of the songs, hymns and prayers&#8212;sometimes hard to tell apart, as she relates&#8212;were collected in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. I may be biased, since I have ancestors from both Ireland and Brittany, but the more I learn about these peoples, the more I love them.The other half, of course, is the Christian part. Here, once again, De Waal does a great job of introducing the reader to a very important story in a way that makes you want to learn more. Christianity came to the British Isles with the Romans, but it was developed in those islands mostly by a particular part of the church, the Benedictines. And the Benedictines drew on an even older tradition in their development, the desert monasticism of St. Anthony of Egypt and so many others. She devotes one chapter to this influence, but she presents only the tip of the iceberg here, as with almost everything else in this book. Because the holy men and women from the monasteries&#8212;and there were a lot more women religious than you might know from this book, which is not a criticism, just an observation&#8212;were the ones who truly converted the Celts, Celtic Christianity was infused with many of the values and the observances of the monastics. The influence of Benedictine spirituality can be seen in two particular things, among many others. One included praying throughout the day and the year, according to both the church calendar and the seasons of nature. Another is the influence of the Psalter, the Book of Psalms, on the prayer life of Celtic Christians.As many reviewers of this book have noted, this is not a how-to book for &#8220;doing&#8221; Celtic Christian prayer. Instead, it is a book that tells us the &#8220;what&#8221; of Celtic Christian prayer and therefore spirituality. The Celtic peoples prayed differently and seemingly much more often than other Christians. De Waal shows us how Celtic Christianity reflects the pre-Christian, that is, pagan culture of the Celts. Theirs was a world full of &#8220;thin&#8221; places, those places where the physical, material, everyday world of our five senses and the laws of physics intersected with the non-material but no less real world this is beyond those senses and laws. The Celts did not separate the &#8220;spiritual&#8221; and the &#8220;material&#8221; and they did not have &#8220;church&#8221; and then &#8220;the rest of life.&#8221; Their spirituality involved everything in their environment and everything they did. Practically everything they did from their rising in the morning to their laying down at night involved something sacramental. And sacraments always involve prayer. De Waal explains well how Celtic Christians saw themselves as always in the presence of and accompanied by &#8220;a great cloud of witnesses&#8221; that included not only angels and other heavenly hosts, but also dark and demonic forces as well.Echoing her historical forebears of the 1800s, De Waal notes that it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to separate prayers from charms, blessings, curses, and poems. And the beauty of those &#8220;Songs of the Gaels,&#8221; to use Alexander Carmichael's phrase, were as beautiful and intricate and earthy and evocative as the artwork of the great stone crosses or the Celtic knot-work patterns best illustrated&#8212;quite literally&#8212;in the Book of Kells. I knew about and have explored some of Carmichael's great collection of Scots Celtic prayers, the _ Carmina Gadelica _. I had never before heard of Douglas Hyde's similar collection, also made in the late 1800s, in Ireland, which he published as _ Religious Songs of Connacht. _ I will have to add that book to my library as well, now.In the introduction, De Waal makes clear what I think is a vitally important point, because it gets to a problem for so many Western Christians today. Celtic Christianity represents an ancient Christian usage that developed before the big split in Christianity between the intellect and feeling, and the mind and the heart, before the scholars in the universities took things over and made it all about thinking correctly about God and the faith. Later, as she notes, faith develops into an almost Darwinian struggle for eternal survival, a very individualistic enterprise. The Celts lived very differently, and we would do well to emulate them. She thinks, and I agree with her whole heartedly, that there is much we could learn from the Celts. In her own words:For I have found in Celtic understanding nothing of the highly individualistic, competitive,inward-looking approach common in today's society. Here, instead, everyone sees them-selves in relation to one another, and that extends beyond human beings to the wild creatures,the birds and the animals, the earth itself....Here is the promise of a more holistic approach tothe world, of healing of the many fractures that maim and corrupt each of us and the world inwhich we live.I don't emphasize this out of any kind of anti-intellectualism. I am a retired academic myself. But De Waal is right. We can't live our lives by stop-watches and an ever-more-precise calculus of whats-in-it-for-me strategic planning. I can't help think about people I have known personally, and a few very prominent politicians these days who somehow manage to pull off in their own minds being followers not only of Jesus Christ, but also Ayn Rand. How can we claim to love God with all our hearts, and souls and minds, and yet treat other people and the planet we live on so horribly? Celtic spirituality is a tonic that all of us in the West need to add to our daily lives.There is so much to learn here. Peregrinatio, the peculiar pilgrimage of the ancient Celtic monks. The three martyrdoms, red, white, and green (or blue). The way Trinitarianism fundamentally undergirds everything in Celtic spirituality. The sheer earthiness and joy-in-creation of Celtic Christianity. That so much joy permeates a people whose lands were so dominated by crosses of such beauty, symbolism, and spiritual power. And especially, perhaps, how their prayer lives were dominated by praise, celebration, and thanksgiving, not petition.After continuing to read references to Esther De Waal's writings in general, and _ The Celtic Way of Prayer _ in particular, I finally decided to buy this book, and I'm glad I did. She did not disappoint. I wish a lot more people would read this book and incorporate its wisdom into their lives. This would be a much better world if that happened.Read this book, and tell lots of people about it.",5.0

The book is a full story as well, meaning it has all of the parts of a real book, which includes an ending.I noticed other reviews saying that this book contained a lot of what goes on in college life. That is not true for me and I feel that many others would agree in saying that their own college lives were much different. For this reason, I would have liked to see more of the other parts of college life. I think the book needed a tad more excitement.I feel like the author hit their mark to reach a certain audience.

6402,"After the heartbreakingly, hopeful ending to One Week Girlfriend, I immediately started this next book. Literally, it was already going on 1AM, but I HAD to keep going. It is contradictory to label an ending as both heartbreaking and hopeful, but it really was. However, Second Chance Boyfriend does not start by immediately picking up the pieces to One Week Girlfriend. Instead, we are left with Drew and Fable working to move forward with their lives. Drew is seeing a therapist to help him work through everything that he has fought so hard to run from in his past, as well as talk to someone about the new information that his stepmother had unloaded on him towards the end of OWG.Fable is approached by a gorgeous stranger and offered a new job waitressing at a higher paying, more affluent restaurant. She is still struggling to keep control over her brother and trying to deal with her alcoholic mother who likes spending all her time with her boyfriends instead of her family or trying to get a job. She is initially attracted to the stranger, but that's really all it is, as she is still so hung up on Drew. She is hurt by his decisions at the end of OWG, and she is even more hurt that he left her a hidden message, which provided her with hope, and after 2 months has not heard anything.I had a hard time liking Fable's new boss, Colin. He kind of creeped me out to be honest. It seemed like his intentions towards her were too noble and that he expected more from her than she was willing to give. However, I'm happy that wasn't the case. Colin is a businessman, but he also cares for his employees and wants them to be sexy, yet tasteful in his restaurants. He doesn't like trouble or drama and  problems with his staff.Jen is another new character who I also really liked. She plays a minor role, but she works with Fable at Colin's restaurant and actually lives with him. We find out he and her older brother were best friends, but you can also tell Jen harbors a crush on Colin. Monica just released their story Three Broken Promises on 12/31.Drew and Fable run into each other again and while things between them are tense, Drew is still protective of his girl and refuses to let her go again. Fable is hurt over Drew leaving her, but he is her weakness and while she tries to stay strong with him she is falling apart inside. She feels used and discarded by the one person who said he loved her and that hurt like hell. Drew has never dealt with his problems in the right way. For most of his life he has been running from them and that is his MO when things get tough. He pushed her away because he was afraid he would lose her anyway- he has gone through some messed up things and doesn't want to drag her down, even though she's already accepted him and his issues.&#34;I don't deserve you,&#34; he finally says. &#34;You accept me so easily, no matter how hard I push you away. You need to know I don't do it on purpose. It's just... the only way I know how to deal is to run.&#34;Second Chance Boyfriend is all about second chances and moving forward, but not just for Drew and Fable. Drew has to face his past and come clean with his father about what really happened with Adele. His father needs him more than ever after realizing Adele's true nature, but Drew hates that he is the go-to guy about this woman. Adele is the last person he wants to think about, much less discuss with his father, but his father needs guidance. He wants to divorce Adele, but he is so blindsided by this evil woman, he hesitates. Adele threatens to shatter everything and tell Drew's dad about what happened in the past, and I'm thankful as to the way it turned out, as it ends up being a small step to rebuilding Drew and his father's relationship. I hate Adele more than ever and she is one manipulative, evil, crazy witch. She got what she deserved in my opinion.I can't stand Fable's mother either. She is a weak, pathetic excuse of a woman and for her to treat her children the way she did, is absolutely appalling. Fable is older and more jaded than Owen is, and while she is hurt over what her mother did, she isn't completely blown away. Owen on the other hand, genuinely believed his mother cared for him and is really affected by the stunt she pulled. I am really looking forward to reading his book next month to see how he deals with this fallout four years into the future.The biggest thing I love about Drew and Fable is that they both are essentially these broken individuals who rise up and with each other form a bond that is so full of love and beauty that they are able to heal the broken parts of themselves and seek strength in each other. They are consumed by their love for one another, and there is real hope for this young couple. They have their weak moments where they feel they aren't good enough for the other, but they are so attuned to the others' needs and insecurities that they are able to sense when the other needs to communicate and express their fears. Drew is learning to be more open with Fable and not run away from his problems, but to talk to them out instead. Overall, these crazy kids are going to make it.Oh and the poems Drew writes for her?

Someone who can see the rhyme and reason to making money, but knows there isn&#8217;t any whatsoever to love.&#8221;There are not many authors I always trust my heart with unconditionally and irrevocably, but Bella Andre&#8217;s stories not only never disappoint, they seem to leave me in a blissful state of day-dreaminess for days to come. I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again &#8211; The Sullivans series is my personal brand of poison when it comes to romances that are &#8216;good for the heart&#8217;, and there is nothing like the &#8216;Bella magic&#8217; when your heart is in need of some tender loving care.&#8220;Do you think one teeny-tiny little kiss would be that big a deal?&#8220;With you, I&#8217;m certain that no kiss could ever be teeny. Or tiny. Or little.&#8221;Ian Sullivan is a self-made millionaire, a man who has always put his professional interests before his personal ones, and whose dedication to his business empire is only matched by his devotion to his family. Tatiana Landon is a movie star, a young woman whose kind and down-to-earth personality stands in stark contrast to her worldwide fame, as she has managed to preserve her innocence and naivet&eacute; despite the attention she receives wherever she goes. But while Tatiana grew up believing in fairy tales and ended up in a business where she is creating fairy tales for a living, Ian&#8217;s failed marriage acts as a daily reminder that he would never be able to give a woman the fairy tale she deserves.&#8220;Marriage was the only thing that Ian had ever failed at, so badly that he&#8217;d come out of it one hundred percent certain that a wife would never&#8212;and should never&#8212;be in his future again.&#8221;They meet at a beautiful vineyard, in the midst of a wedding, surrounded by family and friends. But they only have eyes for one another. Their attraction is immediate, their connection palpable, but their resolve to do something about it is very different. So they part ways and don&#8217;t see each other again until, some months later, Tatiana walks into Ian&#8217;s office asking for his help &#8211; two weeks of shadowing him at his work as research for an upcoming role. A simple request, one that any other man in his position would kill for, and yet the mere idea of spending time with his greatest temptation, the only woman who makes him lose his composure, proves to be his greatest challenge.&#8220;&#8230; while he was normally known for his self-control, from the first time they&#8217;d met, nothing about his reaction to Tatiana had been anywhere close to normal.&#8221;Tatiana is like no other woman Ian has ever met, she is uncomplicated, naturally open and demonstrative, and she does not play games when it comes to expressing her emotions. Her genuine belief in love everlasting is contagious, even for a pragmatist like Ian, but while Tatiana believes to have found her Prince Charming in him, Ian is convinced that he could never make a woman truly happy, especially someone as deserving as Tatiana.It all starts with an innocent kiss, but the fireworks that follow could light up the sky on a moonless night. They complement each other in every way, their every touch reveals what lies in their hearts, but only one of them is willing to admit their feelings for the other. They get a unique taste of what their happily-ever-after would be like if they both allowed it to happen, but it all ends too soon and what is left in its aftermath tastes sourly of heartbreak and regret.&#8220;One day, she hoped, she&#8217;d be the one glowing from being loved so well.&#8221;This is a story about a man who never believed in love and the woman who gave him a reason to start believing in it. Ian is a man whose loyalty and sense of responsibility towards his family have affected every single decision he has ever made in his adult life, his professional drive always overriding all matters of the heart, but then a beautiful woman walks into his life, one who wears her heart on her sleeve, who chooses him to give herself to body and soul, and who never gives up on him, no matter how many times he pushes her away. Tatiana is perhaps my favourite Bella Andre leading lady to date, her fearless determination and willingness to risk breaking her own heart for what she believes to be true, makes her a true heroine in my eyes. She never loses her child-like innocence and even soul-wrenching heartbreak never hardens her &#8211; she simply keeps loving and believing in love.I adored this story, it made me feel so many different emotions, it made me love the characters and every one of their traits, and it left me smiling ear to ear. Very few authors know how to warm my heart time after time, but when it comes to Bella Andre, it&#8217;s always a sure thing.&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t looking for you, Tatiana. I didn&#8217;t see you coming. I didn&#8217;t expect you to burst into my life and turn it upside down.&#8221;",5.0

6414,"I like Lieberman&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;Story&#8221; in his title because he has written a remarkable tale about the how and the why of our bodily origins and the transitions from one form to another through time.  He argues forcefully that many of our features, which were adaptive in the environments for which we evolved, are now maladaptive in the modern environments we have created.To reach the current time, Lieberman explores millions of years of evolution explaining the physical changes that occurred during several key transitions:&#8226; The earliest human ancestors diverging from the apes&#8226; Their descendants adapting to forage and eat a wide variety of food&#8226; Earliest human genus developing nearly human bodies (2 million years ago)&#8226; The Ice Age and archaic humans; bigger brains; homo sapiens survives&#8226; Modern humans evolving capacity for language, culture, and cooperation&#8226; Upper Paleolithic period; thinking, innovating, mass producing tools (~ 50,000 years ago)The focus throughout the above discussion is how variable environments triggered adaptation of various parts of the body.  Thus, Lieberman assesses what it took physiologically to become upright and the trade-offs associated with such a transition.  He discusses walking, running and the necessary development of the feet and leg muscles, both slow and fast twitch type, and the consequences of each; tendons, ligaments, bones, the ear canal for balance, etc. also get significant attention.  There is a full and interesting discussion of how we became creatures of physical endurance.  Lieberman elaborates on the central role diet plays in supplying the energy for growth, activity and, critically, the storage of such energy for lean times.  Additionally, he reviews tool-making and hand development along with the growth and coordination of structures that facilitate throwing.  The discussion of face size and the positioning of the larynx, which enabled the development of speech, were particularly gripping especially considering the potential cost of asphyxiation.The author emphasizes that understanding where we have come from physically enables us to evaluate what we are, and are not, adapted for and hence why we get sick.  Essentially, we humans have evolved to crave energy-rich foods, including simple carbohydrates like sugar that used to be rare, and who efficiently store excess calories as fat.  The middle portion of the book tells how farming and the industrial revolution had many positive but also negative effects on our health relative to our evolutionary history.Lieberman then tells of the more modern ills such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity, GI ailments and many others.  He excellently describes how the various organs and body systems function when healthy and what goes wrong physiologically with them when disease occurs.  We now live in an environment which allows for diseases of affluence, i.e. we have too much of what once was rare (food) and too little of what was once common (exercise).  Since food is now so readily available, our evolutionary developed desire can lead to excess consumption which easily leads to the devastating harm caused by diabetes which is at record levels and continues to increase. The previously common physical activity of hunting and gathering is greatly reduced due to modern conveniences.  Such reduction leads to significant &#8220;disuse&#8221; disease such as osteoporosis.  Again, we have evolved for activity and the technological advancements of the modern world reduce physical activity dramatically relative to our evolutionary origins.  Consequently, we tend to have conditions of physical weakness, debilitation and considerable heart disease.  Lieberman provides numerous descriptions of such &#8220;mismatches&#8221; between our current life styles and our evolutionary past.The professor writes clearly, forcefully, and for the most part, persuasively.  In describing the negative impact of our current environment on our health I felt that his emphasis created too much room to rationalize that an individual can do little to avoid the potential harm of dietary abundance and limited physical activity.It seems to me that the old wisdom of a broad, diverse diet filled with fruits and vegetables along with a regular dose of vigorous physical activity will do much to negate the harmful affects of a challenging environment. I liked and learned much from this book and heartily recommendation it.I conclude that the author is telling us that in order to be healthy we need to strive to be good animals &#8211; because, even with our minds, that is what we are.",5.0
6415,"This book really isn't what I expected and a good deal of the book appears to be a paleo-diet book in disguise.  The language choice by the author is, I find, rather peculiar and well outside of what one would expected in a serious anthropological assessment of the available evidence.  In the beginning of the book the author repeatedly mentions the fact that chimps do some hunting, but fails to mention that meat plays a very small role in their diet and that chimps gain very little by eating it (e.g., the energy content of the meat isn't justified by the effort they make hunting/chewing it).  After this, one chapter starts by claiming that there is &#34;irrefutable evidence&#34; that Homo Erectus was eating meat.  This, of course, is hyperbole....nothing in science is irrefutable.  But its even more problematic because the evidence isn't strong, all we know is that some hominids were cutting things off bones.  Assuming it was for meat is putting the cart before the horse.  Throughout the book the author uses the phase &#34;hunter gather&#34; to refer to our non-human paleolithic ancestors (e.g., Homo Erectus), yet its by no means established that our early ancestors had subsistence methods that are consist with modern hunter gather groups.  Using modern hunter gather groups as models for our paleolithic ancestors is a deeply problematic and leads to numerous dubious conclusions.  The details our of evolutionary history are entirely absent from this book.....perhaps because they would put serious doubt in what Lieberman is suggesting.  The book reads as if our evolutionary tree has one branch that goes from our common ancestors with chimps to modern humans.....but this picture is by no means accurate.  There were numerous hominids in the paleolithic era that were not our ancestors, indeed, under the most widely accepted theory the species (i.e., Homo Erectus) the author spends a good deal talking about may not even be our ancestor.In any case, from an anthropological perspective, I found very little in this book to take seriously and the language use and what the author decided to exclude and include is rather peculiar.  Beyond that, I found the book to be overly chatty and just a bit boring.  The discussion on feet, yeah feet, was perhaps the most interesting.",2.0

6418,"Stephen King has written a humdinger of a thriller which starts with a bang and continues to hold you on the edge of your seat till the very end.Everyday we drive automobiles that could be as dangerous as an automatic assault rifle. In the hands of MR MERCEDES an automobile mowed down a crowded line of desperate job-seekers waiting for what was advertised as ""1,000 GUARENTEED JOBS"". (Was this a deliberate misspelling or an editing mistake?) At the height of the recent US recession there were many hopeless people seeking any job available. Janice Cray, a single mother, was one of the most desperate and she had to bring her young baby Patti with her for the long wait in the cold and damp early morning hours. She is befriended by Augie Odenkirk who gives up his sleeping bag for Patti. None of them realises that the grey Mercedes driving over the parking lot was going to accelerate into the crowd and end their lives and those of many others and shatter the lives of the seriously injured.Brady Hartfield is a sociopath who lives with his alcoholic mother. He was the driver of the Mercedes and the only person who enjoyed that day. The power of the slaughter excited his sociopathic mind and everyday he re-lived the excitement of the slaughter, especially the death of the baby. To increase his excitement he tracks down and targets those who have been inadvertently involved, the owner of the stolen Mercedes and the detective who was unable to solve the case.Detective William Hodges has recently retired but is still haunted by the cases that he was not able to solve especially the Mercedes Killer. He has become overweight and depressed, leading a solitary and  unmeaningful life spending long hours watching senseless TV, and even contemplating suicide. One day he gets a letter from someone claiming to be the Mercedes Killer which brings him out of his depression and onto the trail of the killer on his own. His big worry is that the killer may have something even larger planned.King then takes the reader on a hell of a ride with twists, turns, cul-de-sacs and switchback rides while Hodges, an unexpected lover and a weird mixture of Camel Club type friends try to track down the killer before he can strike again. The killer taunts them and hurts them while he plans his ultimate terror strike.King builds up a chilling picture of the development of a sociopath and his thinking processes, and the impact of retirement on a person whose life has centred around his job. His writing skills are brilliant to the very last sentence, which made me laugh out loud. You need to read right through to the end to see what I mean.Stephen King is a master storyteller and in MR MERCEDES shows that he can again write a rattling good book outside the horror genre. The only other book I have read by Stephen King is his time vortex novel 11/22/63 about the assassination of President Kennedy - this one nearly matches the outstanding quality of that story. I would highly recommend MR MERCEDES to all Stephen King fans and also to others, like me, who are hesitant to read his other books because of the horror context. 4.5 stars.My thanks to the publisher for providing a copy of this book for review.",5.0

6436,"This is NOT a happy, laugh out loud book, but it IS beautiful and full of life and the grittiness that comes with it. This story did not go where I was expecting and it caught me off guard so many times. The strength to look oneself in the eye and deal with what you see-never fun and rarely do we see that worked through in a book. I initially found Nat really hard to relate to, she walked me through her mind and how she got to where she was and how she dug herself out of a GIANT hole and became a WHOLE person again-and she did it herself without someone rescuing her-loved that!I read at the gym and this book had me IN TEARS, IN PUBLIC. I haven't cried in public while reading a book since A Song For Julia by Charles Sheehan-Miles. I'm really not a crier, but Randall did it-she moved me, in a big way! This is a story I will think about for years to come.",5.0
6437,"I thought that Hidden was very well written. It was easy to get into the minds of all the characters involved, even when I didn't agree with what they were doing. There were times I almost forgot I was reading a book because it felt so honest and genuine with realistic settings and dialogue. I kept wondering what would happen next and Catherine threw in some twists throughout. The ending felt anticlimactic, but the story was still powerful and intense. I never condone cheating, whether it is physical or emotional, but it was interesting to hear a man's perspective and why he would be led on two different paths. Overall, it was a strong story and I can't wait to read her next novel!Of course, I had to cast this as a movie!Claire: Claire Forlani ([...])Tish: Martine McCutcheon ([...])Jeff: Josh Holloway [...])Tim: Paul Rudd ([...])",5.0

6439,"The writing was mostly good, but the story seemed to drag a bit towards the end. The author could have condensed the story and it would have been much betterAlso, usually the term ""hipster"" is considered pejorative, at least in my experience. The author's use of the term struck me as odd.The biggest problem I had with the book was that it seemed repetitive, as if the author was trying to stretch the material to hit a certain word-count. I found myself skipping pages as certain scenes seemed to drag on and on.Disclaimer:  I paid $11.04 US for this Kindle e-book, so I'm more critical than I would be if it were priced for only a few dollars. For over ten bucks I expect award-winning quality, and this book did NOT deliver, in my opinion.",2.0

6442,"The Zen master has coached some of the best basketball teams of the last 20 years.  Some of his methods, which he talks about in the book, may be a bit unorthodox but how can you question them with all of the success that he has had.  This book is definitely not an X's and O's guide to basketball, but rather a leadership book about getting people to work together.This book has a lot of great stories from these successful teams and offers a lot of great quotes and anecdotes about coaching and leadership.  I love how Phil has found his own religion/spiritualism in many different forms and uses different ways to motivate his players.  He teaches great lessons about motivating players based on their personalities and what they need to learn to be successful.",4.0

6451,"A Blue Tale was a quick, easy and engaging read.  The chemistry between Eli Blue and Deacon Chastain was intense and made all the more meaningful through their original connection.I loved Eli as a character.  Thrown into the spotlight through her father&#8217;s music career, and her mother&#8217;s selfish aspirations for her own success, she grappled with relationships, questioning people&#8217;s motives for wanting her around.  The one constant in her life has been Shaw, but Eli is forced to question that relationship and discovers the difficulty in separating love from that feeling of safety you get with someone you are intimately familiar with.Deacon is an intense, brooding musician, with a bit of a chequered past.  Loyal to a fault, his past causes many challenges for him and just as he starts to connect with Eli it rears its ugly head once again and Deacon must choose between loyalty to his past and the possibility of his future.There is enough of everything in this story, without it feeling cluttered or overdone.  Relationship development between the characters is well paced and there are ancillary characters that add mystery and drama to the story.  You won&#8217;t have to work hard to enjoy A Blue Tale, and I would absolutely encourage you to check out the Playlist on Spotify - it&#8217;s fabulous!4 out of 5 starsVisit the Into the Night Reviews Blog or Facebook Page for book reviews, new release updates, giveaways and more!!",4.0

I was totally involved in the lives of the families, but by the time I got to the end, I was a little tired of how &#34;good&#34; everyone was - especially Lily and Lucy.  They were just a little bit too forgiving and it got to be a hard to believe.  And of course, by the end there was way too much crying (and not by me).  Maudlin is defined as &#34;showing or expressing too much emotion especially in a foolish or annoying way&#34; and &#34;effusively sentimental&#34; and that is the perfect adjective for this novel.",4.0

6455,"I got this series because I liked the plot line of the story. And it was good. However, I had some issues with the writing. There were a ton of grammatical and punctuation mistakes. Not only that, there were things discussed where obviously the author had in mind what should happen but where never translated onto paper. And some of the story didn't make sense. *****spoiler alert***** For instance, the fact that the paid, highly trained body guards can be so easily killed or that Kat actually was someone else. How is it that she could fool the company she worked for or did no one do a background check? How did she go from a paid body guard to a weak female so fast? Jackson fell in love with her so hard he was searching for her for years yet that was never brought up previously nor was it more than a mention. The characters could have been more developed instead glossed over.That being said, I still enjoyed the series and would recommend it. I hope the author can grow and learn as she develops her own style and perhaps get a better editor.",3.0

6458,"Saphora Warren seems to have it all: Married to a successful plastic surgeon, living in a house being featured in Southern Living, with youthful looks that belie her grandmother role.But on the day Southern Living comes to feature her garden party, Saphora is planning to leave her husband, Bender, for his repeated unfaithfulness. When the party's over, she packs her bag, intending to retreat to their Outer Banks house for some alone time. But then Bender comes home early and announces he's dying. Cancer. And her plans vanish into a frenzy of doctor visits and Bender's convalescence at the very house where Saphora planned to escape.Thus the story begins in The Pirate Queen by Patricia Hickman.The family--sons, daughter, grandkids--gathers at the house as Bender battles cancer. Through surgery and further complications, they all cope in various ways. Saphora busies herself with family, including grandson Eddie who is with them from day 1. When they arrive at the beach house, they meet another boy, Tobias, who they eventually learn is also sick.Honestly, it's hard to pin down what I loved about this book. The characters are well-developed, and there's an air of mystery as Saphora tries to discover why her neighbor stays up late digging holes in his yard. There's friendship forged in trial and love discovered and rediscovered. It's not an escape-your-troubles kind of book, but it's not depressing, either. Hope threads through the pages as Saphora discovers treasures hidden within herself and her marriage.I don't read many books whose lead characters are over the age of 50, but it's not really an issue in this book. Saphora has a strength of character and grace about her that I think most women would envy.The Pirate Queen is an honest take on how tragedy can transform a person and a relationship.",5.0
6459,"So much comedy today is the snarky kind, designed to mock this or that group of people.Summers had me laughing at all kinds of people, including people like me.His humorous approach is the welcome and winsome kind where the joke is on all of us.  The foibles of guys and gals, celebrities and working stiffs, Christians and the secular-to-vaguely-spiritual all intertwine into a tale that makes you care about all of them.  If there's a loving God, the people he loves are a bundle of flaws.  But there's no ""those people"" - they are all of us and that's part of the book's charm.If you like romantic comedy, you'll enjoy this story.  And if you don't like romantic comedy, you'll find yourself laughing as Summers riffs on it.",5.0

6468,"This is the perfect book for someone who wants a MC book that is a bit lighter. Although set in a motorcycle club world, it is more of a romance with the MC as a setting. It is actually a sweet story about a girl who sought solace in the one person she&#8217;s always wanted, but never dreamed of having&#8230;her boyfriend&#8217;s brother.Faye has her future all laid out, despite her controlling, overbearing parents. So when her boyfriend betrays her, she throws caution in the wind and through luck and timing has one wild night with the guy she always fantasized about since she was little. That one night leads her down a path that she never would have chosen for herself &#8211; violence, guns, feuds and revenge.Faye was strong when she needed to be. However, she had a vulnerability, especially when it came to Dex. I really liked her. Sure she was an emotional girl who was thrust into a world she never volunteered to be in, but she adapted and let herself see the world for what it really was &#8211; just a bunch of guys who were a family.And then there was Dex. He was not what I expected from a guy in a motorcycle club. Sure he was a bit rough around the edges, but he really was a good guy. There was no stupidity, no male macho ego &#8211; he genuinely wanted to do right by Faye and it was obvious how much he cared for her. He was not at all what I expected.This book was very light. No hard core violence or any other dark scenarios that one would normally find in a MC biker book. It has all the elements of a New Adult book instead &#8211; angst, steamy sex, swoon-worthy. It is a quick read",4.0

6482,I found this particularly interesting to me as an artist - It is built around a lot of information on how involved it was to produce art works in the &#34;old days&#34; - Takes place in Italy and talks about preparing a canvas and paint - As an artist it made me realize how lucky I am to be living today when I can just go to Dick Blick and get everything I need - bring it home in a bag - and begin to paint.

6490,"I was not expecting a lot from The Viking.  After all, it was a free download and I wasn't sure how many more battle scenes, revenge motivated vendettas, etc., filled with blood and guts I could take (obviously I have watched and enjoyed every episode of the History Channel's Viking).  But surprise, surprise, Marti Talbott's The Viking is a different viking tale altogether; following the travails and experiences of a 14 year-old naive viking (Stefan) marooned all alone in Scotland after a failed viking raid.  Stefan soon finds his &#34;calling&#34; as a much needed protector and savior to Jirvel (abandoned wife) and her young daughter Kannak.  Together, they form a team and pseudo family unit to survive numerous obstacles associated with peasant life in the Scottish highlands.I found the story surrounding the lives of these characters, such as how Jirvel came to be abandoned and her history with the local Laird, the growth and maturation of Stefan and Kannak, and the subplots involving the need to change things in a male dominated dark ages society, very engaging.  The book is more of a novelette or short story serving as a prequel to The Highlander Series.  I had not heard or read any of The Highlander Series, but I will because I now care about Stefan, Kannak and Jirvel and want to know more about what happens to them.  This book is an easy and fast read, which in the final analysis, means that the author succeeded in getting a reader (me) interested by writing a good yarn about young people growing up and finding how complicated love and life can sometimes be......which is why I gave the book 4 stars.The Viking won't satisfy a lust for blood and guts battles and may not even be entirely accurate or realistic in its depiction of life in Scotland during the chronological timeframe I assume it covers.  But it is a great story, with well developed protagonists, that I think most any reader of historical fiction would enjoy as a change of pace, if nothing else.",4.0

6495,"WOW!!!  I have enjoyed Victoria Michaels' contemporary romances.  I've been waiting for her to release something new, and I was ecstatic to find out Concealed is a romantic-suspense/thriller, which is one of my favorite genres.  Concealed absolutely gripped me!  I was pulled in immediately in the prologue, and my heart kept racing until the very end!I love how the romance in Concealed is slow, simmering, and butterfly-producing.  Sydney finds herself smitten with the small town of Elton with its handsome sheriff smitten with her!  The connection between Sydney and Wade is written with charm and ease. Just thinking of their first kiss makes me all giddy!  I love it when an author makes me feel that way, don't you?Concealed has everything that I want in a mystery thriller.  There's a good reason why Sydney has been on the run, and the suspense kept my rapt attention page after page.  The characters are all so likeable and well developed.  The people Sydney works with are sincere and fun. Her neighbor is just full of awesome.  Sydney's daughter is the cutest little thing. I ended up caring about them all!  Plus, the pacing of the story is perfect and there were twists that I didn't see coming...goodness!If you're looking for a nail-biting, romantic thriller, I highly recommend Concealed.  I consider this Victoria Michaels' BEST work thus far!Reviewed by Grace at Sweet Spot Book Blog.",5.0

6497,"Tallulah Alameda, or Tee to all her friends, is the best at what she does as a casino hostess at the amazing Crown Jewel casino in Las Vegas. She is a woman of detail, precision, able to grant her high rollers their every desire, within in reason of course, but the one thing she isn&#8217;t able to do is capture the heart of her gorgeous and very sexy boss, Leonidas Ryan. Even when she and her friends concoct Operation Leo and she throws herself at him in the hotel elevator, she is ready to do something she never does &#8211; give up.Leo has a problem. Besides the fact that he&#8217;s in charge of operations while his boss is away on his honeymoon, besides the fact that his employees are competing for a huge bonus and high rollers are planning fake weddings, he&#8217;s trying desperately to stay clear of his gorgeous and oh, so desirable favorite hostess, Tee Alameda. Leo&#8217;s dragon wants her but she&#8217;s not his mate so no matter how much he wants the human woman who makes his dragon roar, he can&#8217;t hurt Tee that way. He knows his dragon form will soon begin to fade, but can he give it up for the love of a human? But when he discovers she could be his mate after all, will Tee still want him once she learns the truth &#8211; that he and many of her friends are actually dragons?After reading LUCK OF THE DRAGON by Susannah Scott, I didn&#8217;t think she could top the amazing delight of dragons, their mysterious life, their relationship to gems, and their shifting and flying. I&#8217;ve always loved dragons and so Susannah&#8217;s dragons are an instant draw for me, but what she does with their stories, their hearts, and their falling in love is beyond good, it&#8217;s great.STOP DRAGON MY HEART AROUND by Susannah Scott is different, delightful, deliciously sexy, and Leo and Tee are a couple to cheer on from the start. Their banter, their arguments, their teasing, and their connection is unique, intriguing, and so satisfying when Tee finally comes around to giving herself over to her heart, instead of her fears. Each has their fears, their secrets, their mysteries, and their desire. All of which pull them together in an undeniable love that will soar as high as Leo&#8217;s dragon can take them.I highly recommend STOP DRAGON MY HEART AROUND by Susannah Scott to anyone who loves romance for romance sake. Even if you&#8217;re not into shape shifting heroes, try this one on for size, you just might surprise yourself and find that you&#8217;re as eager to see the dragons fly as I am. I can&#8217;t wait for more dragons from Susannah &#8211; Mei is going to have to give in to Darius sooner, or later, right? That's a whole other story.***eARC provided by author in exchange for an honest and unscripted review.",5.0

6505,"Because I was an American literature teacher for over thirty years and am enamored by the 1920's and the lives of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, I ordered this book after reading a review in USA Today.  I thoroughly enjoyed the parts about the writing if The Great Gatsby, but the connection to the murder was tenuous indeed.  After a while, I'd just skip those sections.  I already knew a fair amount about the crazy, hedonistic, self-absorbed life style of Scott and Zelda and found it interesting at first, but it got old reading about incident after incident.  I would not recommend it to just the average reader.",2.0

His writing grabs you at the first sentence. It is fresh. It is frolicking. It is fast-paced good fun, elegantly written prose with believably slightly off characters. Asprin used co-writers sometimes........please, please, pretty please, Tony, don't do that.

6523,"Saffron is trying to support a disabled mother after her older brother ran out on them a while back, and stripping at the Prairie Devils night club is the only way she can think of to make the kind of money she needs to keep afloat. After a few run-ins with the rival Grizzlies MC, Saffron's caught Blaze's attention for good, affording her Prairie Devils MC protection, but a brother newly returned and sporting Grizzlies colors isn't helping matters. As in the other stories in this series, both the hero and heroine in this story are unapologetic and brutal about exacting their vengeance, and I think it is refreshing to see a female wear such feelings and actions without appearing too petulant (usually vengeance is a man's domain, but these stories tweak that a bit). Saffron wasn't innocent or clean-cut, she had a bit of dirt in her past and it made her very real for me. Blaze could be selfish and a bit of a brute, but once he made his decision, his devotion to Saffron was awesome and I liked his determination. I hope Tank and Emma's story is next! Great series!Note: This book was provided to me by the author for an honest review.",4.0

6525,"Summary:A class of sophomores receive their annual flu shot and all of a sudden develop the ability to hear each others thoughts.  Each student can now communicate telepathically and find out about all of the thoughts going on around them.  For some, this causes a lot of hurt as secrets are revealed, but mostly, they all learn a lot.My thoughts:I was really impressed with this novel.  I was expecting a fun, light read, and this fits that bill.  I wasn't expecting the creativity and humor involved.  The narration is told through a &#34;we&#34; character.  Since all of the characters are able to share thoughts, then the narrator is really all of the teens.  They all have unique characteristics, so they are easily distinguishable, but they also all know everything about one another and share that knowledge together with the audience.  There is a fairly large cast to keep up with, but I never felt like I missed something or didn't know who had an individual thought that was incorporated into the &#34;we&#34;.  I almost want to teach the book to investigate the omniscient.  What better way to understand what the &#34;all knowing&#34; narrator is like that with this type of character set?  Also, I figured that I would get some chuckles as secrets were revealed, but I didn't expect the snarky one liners that caused quite a few snickers.  I was impressed by the quick set-ups that the author uses to deliver these jokes.  It reminds me of my classroom.  There are always students that are very quick on the uptake and clever with their responses.  This classroom apparently has a student or two that also do that.Overall, this is a very fun book that I would recommend to most of my girls, especially the ones that read Gossip Girl or the IT girl series.",5.0
6526,"I was initially captivated with the story about Nola finding a woman's body in the park while jogging, her boyfriend issues and move to Soline's condo. I loved her investigation methods and relationship with friends but it did slow down a bit with too much focus on her personally before getting back to more work at investigating. It didn't really hold interest...just sort of in and out but the story did become more interesting about 3/4 through. It's a good book, just not a page turner.",3.0

6529,"Enjoyed reading this book, it was fast paced and definitely kept my attention. Didn't see the end coming  which is a nice surprise!  The president brings in an outside group of ex-military patriots (SSI) to clean up the government - something we would all love to see! However, they don't get far before an unrelated attack kills the vice president, injuries the first lady and kills/injures many civilians.  SSI shifts focus and the action never stops.  Would recommend this book and I will be reading more by this author.This is the first book I have read in this series and I rated a 4 (would give a 4.5 it possible) because I did not feel the commarderie between the main characters, the author spells it out but could improve a little on the interactions between the men.  Of course, it may just be because I did not read the previous books.Would recommend this book and I will be reading more by this author.",4.0
6530,"This book comes on the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Glenn Tinder's classic work, The Crisis of Political Imagination. Tinder's book dealt with mass disintegration and the isolation of the individual, along with the failure of the four main classifications of political thinking (liberalism, democracy, socialism and conservatism) to deal with the alienation of great numbers of people from political life specifically and society in general. Sadly, political imagination continues to be in crisis a half century after it was diagnosed by Tinder.Micklethwait and Wooldridge are editors of the Economist ("" a global weekly magazine written for those who share an uncommon interest in being well and broadly informed""). They describe what they call three and a half revolutions in the evolution of government and the state:1. Thomas Hobbes and the Nation-State2. John Stuart Mill and the Liberal State3. Beatrice Webb and the Welfare State4. Milton Friedman's Paradise LostHobbes' contribution was to describe Leviathan, in which the first duty of the state is to be powerful enough to provide law and order. The power of the state frees man from misery and makes human civilization possible. Prior to the existence of the state, man was tossed between fear and greed into an existence that was, by its very nature, brief and brutish. By giving up some of his autonomy to the state, man could work and survive without having to defend himself at every turn from his fellow human beings.Mill feared Leviathan nearly as much as (or even more than) he feared his fellow man. He was born into a family of Victorian intellectuals who devoted their lives to fashioning an alternative to domination by Britain's landed aristocrats and Anglican clergymen. (One need only to read the works of Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens to understand the problems created by the British aristocracy.) His father, James Mill, believed that Britain's traditional overlords were threats to liberty, reason and effort. The public had traded fear of fellow man for tyranny of the state. If one lost his job, he would lose his right to vote and was consigned to semipenal workhouses which were developed to discourage idleness and provide incentives to work and save. Mill argued that the government should have as little as possible a role in the general business and interests of the people.Webb is known as the godmother of the welfare state, which was designed to provide citizens with an ""enforced minimum for a civilized life,"" thereby creating a ratchet toward ever-bigger government. Her object was to train intellectuals and functionaries to staff an ever-increasing administrative machine. Failure to follow the dictates of the state could lead to fines and imprisonment. The administrative state, being unelected and beyond the reach of the people, became a fearful master whose self-interest trumped the interests of the common man.Friedman's economic philosophy caught the eye of Margaret Thatcher, lending intellectual support to the idea of dismantling many aspects of the administrative state by privatizing state-run enterprises, cutting taxes, giving vouchers to parents for schools, etc.  In the United States, Ronald Reagan also came under Friedman's influence, declaring in his First Inaugural Address that ""Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.""The authors suggest, very strongly and with intellectual support, that democratic politicians will always pander to their electorates - and thus build up deficits and underinvestment in infrastructure - a worry that has proven to be painfully accurate. They note that modern nation-states cannot pursue democracy, national self-determination and globalization simultaneously. The result is conflict among the people and increasing regulation of all aspects of life, in direct opposition to the principles upon which constitutional governments were founded.I heartily recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning how we got where we are politically and who want to know what needs to be done to free us from the looming administrative straitjacket. It will be well worth their time to read what the authors have to say.",5.0

The only things that stopped me from giving this one a 5 star review were:1. The book was too short-I finished it in one day. Still a good value for $2.99, but I wish it was longer2. There were enough typos in the book to be annoying. I wish the editing had been a little tighter, although it may have been the readers' fault clamoring for a book release.Overall, I enjoyed Adam immensely and unlike other reviewers a great part of my enjoyment of the series is that the other characters feature prominently in all the books.

6546,"We have read the previous three books in the Threshold Series (The Blue Door, The Hidden Deep, and The Broken Window). I have been reading the series with my 9 year old daughter. We have been enjoying the story of Prissie Pomeroy.Prissie is a teenager who is able to see and interact with angels. She becomes best friends with one, Koji, and has numerous other friends in her community that she discovers to be angels as well. In this book, we see the farewells of many dear friends but the blooming of beautiful relationships with others.The book focuses on Prissie's saying good bye to her friend Koji, as well as the further development of her friendship with the young man Ransom. The most interesting story line with in the book is the interactions with Adin, a fallen angel that has been tormenting Prissie for some time.I think I like the series because even though it is about angels, Kinde always points the characters and the readers back to God who is the only one worthy of devotion. Time and again, we see how easily we can fall from following God's desire and how he provides people or angels to guide us back to his purpose.I don't know if the book would be as enjoyable as the first read of the series, I would recommend starting with the short story Angels All Around and then The Blue Door.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLook Bloggers book review bloggers program.

6553,If there was a rating between three and four stars I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars. It's MUCH better than 'just OK' and I do 'like it' but the main drawback is that the author focuses stitches that not all machines have. I have an older Bernina and a newer (lower-end model) Janome that have plenty of embroidery stitches between them but many of the samples and exercises shown in this book rely on stitches neither of my machines have. I've seen a lot of the stitches shown in the book on newer top of the line 'embroidery' machines but it would be nice to have a book like this that did not presume one has or can afford a machine that can range from several thousand $$$$ to $15000.00 for a deluxe machine.I will get some good use from the book but it will involve a lot of careful consideration of which stitch patterns I can use to substitute for others.

A vegan diet is really a way of life and looks at not just what food is put into the body but also at how vegans respect animals and the environment.  What is great about this book is how it really walks through all the steps on how to incorporate a vegan diet into a person&#8217;s life.  The recipes and ingredients are budget-friendly, and most recipes contain 10 ingredients or less.  These recipes take no longer than 30 minutes to prepare and make and contain no processed foods.  This cookbook gives a realistic approach to veganism and includes ways of incorporating all the vitamins and nutrients a person needs to have a healthy life.

6567,"Ms. Campbell ratchets up the creep factor in this second book in the Horrorscape series. Gavin, or GM, as he calls himself, has turned freakish whack job into an art form. I know the book is a chess game, but to this reader, it kind of felt like playing Clue with Hannibal Lector: You know who did it (or is going to do it) but you have to figure out which weapon and in what room.Val has grown up a bit but still suffers PTSD from the mental trauma inflicted by Gavin her freshman year. With some reticence, Val agrees to go to a party with her boyfriend and a couple of friends. Soon after arriving, she realizes the host is not who he seems. GM is Gavin, although his appearance is different than when she last saw him. He has invited two sets of kids (teams)- one set wearing white and one set wearing black. Then the chess game begins.As the game wears on, the players all realize that GM is playing for real and that their lives are in danger. Val and her friends must get out of that house and away from GM as soon as they can. GM's overconfidence in his ability to seduce Val and his misinterpretation of her wants is his ultimate downfall. The ending leaves possibilities wide open for book three.(less)",5.0

6570,"30 Day Shred Diet Concept is a great motivator that many of us need after the long winter. Cathy Wilson discusses many weight loss issues, from how long to exercise each day (not long! just an hour) to what foods to eat/avoid, how to indulge without making a mess of the whole diet, how to build lean muscle and become healthier in the process. A great book written in a very informal voice and with wonderful humor. Yes, Ms. Wilson, now I get it. I'm not a bear, and I'm ready to stop acting like one. Thanks for the reminder! Five stars!",5.0
6571,Ever since I read the first book in this series I was hooked.  Therefore I have waited for each new release with such longing and excitement in the next chapter in all things Nora.  You always got a glimpse of things that started her love for Soren but this book gave the reader what was needed to fill in all the gaps.  I have always felt such an emotional attachment to Nora and Soren and wanted to know what started it all.  Well...this book gave me that and so much more.  Wow....I can't tell you enough how much I enjoyed this book.  Nora finds herself in the cottage and NIco shows up to be with her.  At the time he is just what she needed and he tries to convince her she is all he needs.  Together they share in each other while Nora tells NIco about his father Kingsley but the only way to do that is to start at the beginning and that includes how she and Soren began.  It was a deeply moving story for me and Tiffany Reisz goes beyond anything I could have ever imagined in the telling of Nora and Soren's story.  It made me feel happy....sad...and most of all the love they shared for each other.  Beautifully written and adding Nico into the mix was brilliant.  If you haven't read the series start with the first book since it all leads to The Saint.  You won't be disappointed and its so much more than just about the BDSM.  Simply amazing is what this entire series is and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book.  Highly recommend!,5.0

6581,"I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest reviewWow! I absolutely loved Evolution: SAGE book two in The Evolution Series. I'm not even sure how to review it since I don't think I really can without major spoilers. It continues right where Evolution: ANGEL left off, which was a bad place for main character Candace. I don't know how it's possible, but I liked this second book even better than the first.Interesting characters, intriguing plot twists, and nonstop action make Evolution: SAGE a real winner. I like the introduction of the shadow organization HEX. It blurs some lines and not only creates extra tension for the ANGELS, but also plants that seed of doubt. I loved that this novel focused more on the tumultuous relationship between Candace and Jackson. The real strength in this novel is the character development and interactions.The ending wasn't really an ending as much as the mother of all cliffhangers.

6589,"My review is based on an Advance Reading Copy (ARC), what used to be called ""galleys"". In this particular case, the ARC is loaded with all kinds of errors which I presume have been corrected in the final print version. The various errors made reading difficult, but I will not penalize the author for that.Author Baime has undertaken a gigantic task here, telling the complex stories of the relationship between the then richest man in the world, Henry Ford, his son Edsel; the politics of being an American company dealing with the Germans in the 1930s; the transformation of America's consumer economy into a war economy; the unprecedented mobilization of the American people; creating a manufacturing plant on a scale never before imagined; mass producing one of the most complex machines the world had ever seen, the B-24 bomber, in massive quantities; the air war in Europe and the European war in general . . . and more.The author has done a good job of weaving all this together into a readable popular history. He is handicapped by his own limited command of the English language and his writing skills and style. Neither of those impediments, though, are anywhere near fatal. They just make life difficult for the reader.Baime has done his research. In fact, amateur history buffs like myself will find little new here. People interested only in the war will fnd the first 60 pages frustrating as they are a mini-biography of Henry Ford, a man who has merited huge volumes dedicated to him.Overall, though, I think this is a good read for anyone who is interested in WWII and how it came to be that the United States did indeed become the ""arsenal of democracy"", which began life as a line in a Franklin Roosevelt speech and in an amazingly short period of time, became a reality. That transformation was in fact something we will never see again.Baime is not the easiest to read, but he has done  his homework and does tell a more than adequate story. He might have benefited from narrowing his scope and by being more careful in his choice of words, but overall this is an informative and interesting popular history of a complex time in human history.Jerry",4.0

6603,"This book provides biographies for a number of Americans that are noteworthy for their environmental activism in recent years. Some of these are rather colorful characters, and the author generally does a good job to fill the pages with interesting details about them.That being said, there are a number issues I have with the book.First I feel that it fails to keep the distance and objectivity that a good biographer should have from his subjects. The book is written in a activist, good guys vs. bad guys style that does not leave a whole lot of room for critical thinking.Second, the book is somewhat anticlimactic. It simply runs out of steam towards the end, the depiction of the the characters gets progressively shorter and shallower. Almost like the author had an assignment to cover x people and ran out of time to meet the deadline.Third, I really dislike the title. It sounds crummy, there is no obvious connection to the robber barons of yore, and it is misleading too, as many of the people in the book are not even rich.",3.0

6609,"Not every relationship ends roughly. Some do, yes, and some don't. This book is obviously about the relationships that somehow never had that dramatic, hate-your-guts-forever ending. In my case, I have experienced both, a love that ended in a lifetime of hate, and a love, that never ended...If you give this book a chance, it is a very personal read. You have to replay in your mind past moments of joy and happiness, and equally reflect on what it was that caused you to go separate ways. Sometimes, you can backtrack, and return, and other times, it is no longer possible.As time and distance multiplies, it is most likely true what the great poet Robert Frost had to say, (quote) ""Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh, Somewhere ages and ages hence...(end of quote)I recommend this book for anyone who has not ""traveled"" far away from a lost love, who is close in time and distance, so as to go back, if it is possible. In my case, this book comes much too late...I can no longer go back to my lost love... Instead...I must go forward to where I have found the greatest love of my life...my dear Gaby. This book gets a rating of 4 stars because there are people like myself for whom this book will be useful only as a pretext for a reflection. For others, however, this book is golden.

Entire threads of plot and character felt missing and pieces felt as though they were tossed in just to either move something along or provide a comment for something later, but often these didn't materialize into anything.

His friend's wife (who is also an old friend of the investigator) has been found dead - under very similar circumstances to Booker's younger brother's unsolved murder nearly 20 years earlier. Drawing on his last bit of strength to try to solve the case, he is assisted by his long-time friend Numi, who has been acting as his unofficial 'caretaker'. Booker reflects on his life, his illness (AIDS from unprotected sex with a previous girlfriend who was a carrier, then lung cancer that is incurable), and his relationship with Numi (who is gay, while Booker is not).

It opens with an introductory note indicating some of the &#8220;novel&#8221; is fictionalized from real events, and then the story begins&#8230; but, it&#8217;s not a novel with a single story, or even a single literary form, in fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s a novel at all; it&#8217;s a hybrid text, and one a lot of people will get into intensely! Through stories, creative non-fiction narratives, and poems, Akley delivers a meditation on the varied lives of pot smokers. Ranging from a trippy pot run road trip, to a true life murder investigation, to emotional ruminations in poetry, Crossroads from Damascus is always interesting and often surprising. One thing I really liked about it was that it can be read sequentially or picked up and read in parts, and I&#8217;ll keep it around on my kindle for just that reason.

6628,"I downloaded this book as it was the April choice for my book club. I was surprised at the high price (close to $16), as the book was published in 1996, and disappointed that this was a higher price than the paperback version. Once I got used to the meandering, and at times disjointed narrative style, I became quite immersed in the book. Although I found Slovo's narrative to be somewhat self-absorbed at times, overall, I enjoyed this book for two reasons: it made me realise the sense of deprivation, lack of love and sense of identity that besets the children of parents who are either celebrities or have high public profiles. So much of the narrative seemed a cry for recognition and love. Slovo's frustration at her parents' indifference made me think of a number of children of famous parents who go off the rails or commit suicide - Peach Geldof being a recent one. The second reason I enjoyed the book was that it gave me a real glimpse of South Africa during the Apartheid era-  for example, Slovo's shock when arriving in England and seeing a white person clean her steps, as she had only seen blacks do manual work. She conveyed convincingly through the depiction of her unsettled childhood the atmosphere of fear and secrecy that dominated her everyday life. The fact that her mother's violent death did not come as a surprise says it all. Having read quite a lot of articles and books about many of the black activists from that time such as Mandela and Tambo, it was also interesting to observe the lives of significant white activists such as Slovo's parents from that era. I will read the book again. Interestingly, our book group were very divided about the book - some loved it, and some couldn't relate to it and chose not to finish it.",4.0
6629,"If you read a lot of YA Dystopia, you're going to recognize quite a few of the plotlines in this book.  In the first few pages alone, you'll think of Birthmarked, The Testing, Tandem and a few others.  You'll be forgiven if you start to think that you've read this all before.However, author does a lot of things right.  The book isn't wholly derivative.  Every time you think you know where the plot is going, the author pulls out a surprise.  While not an edgy book by any means, the author does skirt some controversial topics.The main thing that pulls this one down to three stars for me is Benjy.  Benjy is not only the love interest, he's also the sole reason that Kitty makes almost every decision she makes.  No Benjy, no plot.  The problem is that Benjy is barely a sketch of a character.  In one scene, Benjy gives Kitty a drawing of some stick figures.  The scene stuck with me because it perfectly described Benjy for me - an outline of a real boy with no substance.  The fact is that I didn't care if he lived or died.I think, had the author spent more time on Benjy, fleshing him out, I would have enjoyed this book much more.Three Stars.",3.0

6634,"Charlotte has many nicknames and she hates most of them. While Charles and Chuck are still bearable, its &#8216;The Husbandmaker&#8217; tag that she hates the most. Smart, beautiful, witty and sporting, Charlotte has all the qualities that a man could ask for in a girl, yet something always gets in the way for Charlotte. When Kyle Aldsworth enters the scene, Charlottes gives it another chance. Will she walk down the aisle finally?Charlotte is a girl that I would want to be like. She has all the good qualities that one can hope for. Kyle is a strong, caring and sporting person himself. While they make a good couple, it is just not enough. With Kyle&#8217;s political aspirations and by association Charlotte&#8217;s time in the limelight may not be what Charlotte wants for life. Usually, I would consider this as a spoiler, that they do not end up together, but the ending left me flabbergasted. Though I can guess who Kyle goes on to marry, I was disappointed that Charlotte didn&#8217;t really find the fairy tale ending &#8211; yet again. The ending of this installment left me unsatisfied and wanting more &#8211; ensuring that I would pick up the next installment in the series. But it also made me not so happy with this installment. The courting and dating period seemed fun but ultimately the individual aspirations came in between them. But I swear if she ends up with Angus at the end, it would be most disappointing.Overall, this book made for a fun and light read with its not so predictable (well you would expect the protagonists to end up together in a predictable storyline) plot and good and strong narration.",3.0

6638,"At first, as a modern reader I was impatient and wished the story would move along, but as I sat back and realized it was not about the destination but the trip I found reading the story was much like being rowed in my own gondola, watching the story unfold through the curtains.  I really got a sense of the main character and his fight with his destiny and what his soul wanted.  And as much as I would have liked more details into the other character stories I also realized that what the author showed us is what any other self absorbed person in love would have noticed.  I felt like she kept giving us tantalizing peeks into the other stories that ebbed and flowed around Luca and it made me want more and I felt a little disappointed at being left to wonder how everything worked out in the end.  But then again, that's life isn't it, we don't always get the neat little package wrapped up with a bow.",4.0

6643,"It&#8217;s a marvel what the ancients achieved minus the technology modern man employs. In certain areas their mastery leaves little room for addition, if not improvement. This book provides a look into the close attention Greece and Rome paid to rhetoric; the art, the science, the craft &#8211; whatever it be considered &#8211; of language&#8217;s use to convey or convince or explain. Rhetoric has nothing to do with words in the singular but everything to do with them in combinations. In those days oratory mattered to anyone seeking a place among the hierarchy. Oratory conjured action. Rhetoric gave oratory its juice.Originally rhetoric applied not to documents but the utterance. Not only in politics did it reign but in law. As Demosthenes persuaded Athenians to oppose Phillip of Macedonia, so did Cicero persuade the Roman senate to outlaw Cato. In those days rhetoric rendered by pen was negligible, by voice it was foremost in public affairs.Oratory these days lacks the prominence it once had. Politics and trials depend more on agreement between influential individuals (the latter with a lawyers opening and closing statement has the edge over the former). Rhetoric as a study to aid a speaker on a survey of university curriculums is not even conspicuous by its absence. If reduced to near invisibility in the aural arts, rhetoric retains a visible presence in the written ones. Thus, this handbook of rhetorical terminology has value to a person interested in enhancing his/hers writing beyond the mechanics of punctuation, grammar, and usage. However rhetoric is not a cure-all. John Lyly&#8217;s Euphues is as bad in its excess of rhetoric as Dick and Jane is in its paucity of the same. Besides valuing rhetoric the ancient Greeks valued moderation too.",5.0

6647,"While I really enjoyed the premise of this book the ending left a lot to be desired. There were just so many threads left open in this book. I understand that this is a series and it's going to answer each question like where is Allie and is she going to come back, and where and what is going on with Greta (Josh's sister) in each of their own stories I just thought we could have got a bit of a wrap up. I would have liked more of a conclusion between Devon and her dad and also with Josh. It kind of just ended with her revelation and didn't show the future or anything which I really enjoy a the end of the books I read. This book just ended very abruptly for me and unfortunately that negatively affected my overall outlook on the book.I don't think I will read Allie's story because I already don't really like her. I mean okay she ran off on her wedding day and that's a dick move to someone you claim to care about but I was more upset with the fact that she dated her best friends ex-boyfriend. She was fully aware how those two felt about each other but she decided to date him and then get married to him in less than a year and asked Devon to be at the wedding. All of those things are just not okay in my book. Especially when she clearly wasn't in love with Josh, I think that makes it all the more worse.So unfortunately for me my questions will remain unanswered when it comes to this series.",2.0

6651,"I fell in love with this book the moment I read the dedication.  That alone was powerful,  inspiring, and set the perfect mood for the book.  I won't reveal what it says because I want you to read it and experience it as you are supposed to.&#34;Sometimes bad things happen in life. Sometimes they happen when you're really young.  These are the memories that wont fade with time.&#34;  For those of us who fell in love with Brand earlier on in the Beautifully Broken series this book felt long overdue. He is a mystery that every woman wants to unravel. Nora Greene has wanted to indulge in him for years. ever since she was a teenager. He was her dream man, the one that she compared all others to. All of us ladies have that man, for some of us he is fictional though.  An accident occurs and Nora sees her chance to get in with Brand,  and she takes it.This entire series is filled with people who have troubles in their lives. They are somewhat dark and twisty inside, We all are. That is why what Courtney does is so appealing to us all. We love the dark and twisty people, or as she puts it the Beautifully broken. There is something inside of all of us that wants, no needs, to see other people overcome their obstacles and have a happy ending. It gives us all hope that we can do the same.With every book in this series that she writes you feel a tiny piece of your own soul that heals with the characters. You may not face the same problems, but we are all facing something. These books don't hold back. They are more than just fiction. If you allow it, fiction can heal the soul.&#34;Being brave doesn't mean not being afraid, Nora, it means being afraid and doing it anyways.&#34; Although they come together in an unconventional way they get eachother from the beginning. They know that they both have demons and they don't pry to make the other bring theirs to the surface. They slowly learn to trust eachother and they learn to need someone in the best kind of way.As with the other books in this series their are a few &#34;adult scenes&#34; although this book, I believe, is one of her more tame ones. It deals with some very mature situations. Brand and Nora have real struggles, the kind most of us just have nightmares about. Take the adventure and watch them heal from the outside in. You will love this book.  Also, don't worry, the ending is spectacular. You couldnt possibly be disappointed if you've loved all the other books in the series.xoxo**I recieved an ARC in exchange for a honest reivew**",5.0
6652,"Emmi is a week late starting college so all the dorm rooms are full, she's renting a room from a guy, a guy she's never met so this is a gutsy move. Now the roommate is Braxton and he's probably the best looking guy she's ever seen, he's tall, muscled and a MMA fighter but he knows it, he's a player, in fact her arrival interrupts his 'playing' so he's not happy and makes a point of explaining the number one rule 'no cock-blocking' ever. Now Braxton is so cocky it never occurs to him that Emmi would ever say 'no' to him, I mean after all she's female.I personally love different POV books So this was perfect for me, at first Braxton is what you'd expect, a conceited man-whore but the more you read the more you come to understand that he's not just a dumb jock. I liked both Emmi and Braxton, although not so much Braxton in the beginning, he grew on me. Emmi is a great female character and it's rare for me to find one that I like all the way through a book, admittedly this is a short book but she didn't have a single too stupid to live moment, which was great.Now you could argue that this book is nothing new, and it isn't, but then not many books are, it's reminiscent of 'Beautiful Disaster' at times but then it's bound to be considering it's college, he's a MMA fighter, also a man-whore, but he's a nice guy really, she's a girl who can say no and she sees past the image...you get the picture. This book is well written and I really liked it but then I liked the both the main characters which is the main stumbling block for me and I agree with the other reviewer this feels like a much longer book.I knew this was a cliffhanger book because I got 'Consumed' and 'Devoured' at the same time but I don't know how many books are in this series.",4.0

Although he was enchanted with her as they shared time and grew closer, he chose to tell Sadie that their new romance was over when he left to move out of state to help his mother.Sadie was planning the marriage of her dreams when she was jilted by her fianc&eacute;, Trey. Not only did Trey leave her but he married her younger sister who was light and carefree rather than intense and focused like Sadie. Sadie developed a rule of one date only after that betrayal until she met Aiden and let her shields drop. She was excited about the chemistry she had with Aiden and the gentle intimacy they had even without sex. Then he ended their blooming relationship leaving her more heartbroken, angry and distrustful.A year later Aiden and Sadie are pushed together at his brother&#8217;s wedding to her best friend. Then Sadie discovers that Aiden is the new manager of Axle&#8217;s local motorcycle shop, an account she has been pursuing for three years. Sadie gets the account which puts her working closely with Aiden who hopes to buy the chain of shops when Axle retires.Aiden regrets giving up Sadie and would love to get her back in his arms and life. But Sadie remembers the hurt and wants to protect herself even though the chemistry still runs hot between them.  The attraction between Aiden and Sadie begins quickly and builds through the story. Both characters have flaws and insecurities that are realistic. Sadie is particularly annoying with her wanting to protect herself from any pain when life and love just don't work that way.I was cautious selecting this title to review as I wasn't sure how sexy it would be and I generally prefer contemporary reads with suspense or mystery plots rather than just romance. This story is definitely all romance and the conflict exists around Aiden's desire for a second chance and Sadie's reluctance to take a risk. This read quickly and the sex, though sensually detailed,  is sweet and not gritty graphic.  I recommend this to readers who enjoy pure romance and especially like second chance stories.I received this title from Hachette through NetGalley for an honest review.",4.0

6691,"Reviewed by Grace for Sweet Spot Book Blog4 &#8211; 4.5 Stars&#8220;You own my every thought, my heart, and my soul.&#8221;When I read the first Welcome to Paradise book (Good Vibrations), I thought Evan and Mallory were just the most adorable couple ever!  S.L. Scott wrote a couple who realized right away that they had something very special.  Evan and Mallory are young, carefree, and so much in love.  The gorgeous Hawaiian backdrop is the cherry on top!  Going through the series, they seem to hit several obstacles that try to tear them apart.  Although there was a lot of tension, a lot of ups and downs, these two never lost focus on what they truly wanted, which was to be together.  Even apart they made things work the best way they knew how.Both Mallory and Evan do a lot of growing in Good Sensations.  Each stand their ground as people and stress from work and school make things difficult.  They always seem to have their work cut out for them.  My gosh, are they so hopelessly in love and full of naughtiness!  One of the things I've enjoyed is all the banter between the friends.  You gotta love friends who are funny and super supportive. Mallory's dad, Clay, steals some scenes in this book, too!I think it's more enriching reading the books in this series in order.  They meet in book 1, then each book after is a continuation of their whirlwind love affair.  Good Sensations is my favorite of the trilogy.  The entire second half of this book is dreamy.

6692,"My &#8216;Blogging Reader&#8217;s Review&#8217; after reading &#8216;DIVERGENT&#8217; by Author Veronica Roth (via: Booksmoviesfandoms.wordpress.c o m):I first read this novel over a year ago and really enjoyed the story of Divergent.  There is the first novel of the Divergent trilogy novel series by Veronica Roth and you can expect an entertaining blend of action, suspense and romance.  The story is written in one P.O.V.(point of view) which follows the experiences of a young sixteen year old girl named Beatrice Prior living in a futuristic dystopian Chicago.  Most people have conformed to a government organized grouping of it&#8217;s citizens.There are 5 groups which are known as &#8216;factions&#8217;. Each faction consists of citizens who specialize and represent one particular virtue and live among others of the same faction.  Those factions are: ABNEGATION (which are the Selfless), DAUNTLESS (which are the Brave), AMITY (which are the Peaceful), CANDOR (which are the Honest) and the ERUDITE (which are the Intelligent).  All five factions have lived together, yet separately, with no issues and chose the Abnegation to govern their societies because of their lifestyle of selflessness.When students of these factions become sixteen, they must go through a process to help them choose a faction that fits them best.  They may choose the one they are born into or transfer to another.  Beatrice and her brother who is only a little bit older than her, Caleb Prior, must choose what faction is best for them individually.  If they choose to go to another faction, they must say goodbye to their families because of their motto which says it all: &#8220;Faction Before Blood&#8221;.Once Beatrice chooses her faction, there is a competitive initiation of tests that begin.  Under the process of extreme physical challenges, then emotional simulated tests, followed by intense mental and psychological simulations will decided if she and her fellow initiates will be a part of the faction or become one of the &#8216;factionless&#8217;.  Beatrice, who chooses to go by &#8216;TRIS&#8217; now,  must not only survive and pass the initiation process but she must also figure out the social aspect inside of the faction.  Tris must figure out who are her friends and who will do anything to win.  And then there is her somewhat mysterious instructor who simply goes by the name of &#8216;FOUR&#8217;.  He is only eighteen but seems very mature and skilled within the faction.  I definitely recommend this novel because it&#8217;s a part of a very interesting series that does not focus on romance, suspense or action, it gives an equal amount of it all in an entertaining fashion. Check this series out and read it before you go check out the first book to movie adaptation &#8216;Divergent&#8217; in theaters now.My star rating for 'DIVERGENT' is: 4 out of 5 stars! :)Visit my Blog and see Memorable quotes and photos of the characters of DIVERGENT.",4.0
6693,"Note to authors: &#34;loop your bands back to where they started&#34; do not adequate instructions make. You included several good pictures and instructions for placing the bands, but completely dropped the ball when explaining how to loop the bands together. The order DOES matter, as anyone who has made a simple bracelet can attest, and after spending several hours on just the mouse design (and failing over and over again), I'm going to return this book and get my money back. It's books like these that cause people to give up on crafts and blame themselves, saying &#34;I guess this craft just isn't for me&#34; when it's your lame instructions that are to blame.

6699,"Novel is set in the war years, 1941-5.  Protagonist Bob Jones, a black ship yard worker--and human time bomb--is at war with the white world and with himself. Seemingly pathologically oversensitive, and obviously on the make, Bob is hard to like or empathize with.  The novel bogs down at mid-point, the language increasingly prosaic, and plods forward somewhat interminably. As description of the LA ship yards during the war, the book's sociological value may equal the literary.  Overly serious--a not atypical defect for a first novel--the book is without a hint of the humor commonly found in Himes's later work. W.F.

6700,This was a  romance between a baseball player and a beauty queen.  They meet under somewhat negative circumstances but seem to have an instant connection.  They gradually get to know each other by telephone as he plays games out of town.He is living under the pressure of a father that was a real jerk.  I would call him something worse but then it would cancel out my review.  He is doing the same thing to his son that his father did to him and he doesn't see it.  Baseball seems to be the only answer!  She sees his son as a young boy that wants to go in another direction.  So there is a clash of wills.I thought she let him off the hook way to quick.  But it is a good story and a HEA.  I would have liked to have seen the father get his just deserts but that didn't happen!  I do recommend the book.  It was an enjoyable read.  A little on the sexy side so be prepared for that.  Just added to the story for me.  I would imagine most baseball players are a little on the sexy side in real life too.  Good read.,4.0

6704,"The Polaris Uprising is one of the best science fiction books I've read in a long time. Ryla and Alanna were fascinating characters and I grew to love them both. Ryla is set to inherit the role of President from her father. She is being groomed to follow in his shoes and to make the tough decisions without looking back....but when she finds out the type of decisions her father has been making she has second thoughts. She realizes how opressive her father's rule has been, and what people are being made to give up every day.Alanna, on the other hand, is there to support her father (and by default her sister), but when the two collide her loyalties will be tested - she will have some of the most difficult decisions to make. In an amazing and dystopian world full of just enough fancy technology to make it new, and just enough humanity to keep you locked into every page I finished this book in record time.While the book does not end in a cliff hanger - I am eagerly waiting the next one so I can see how everyone's choices will play out.*This book was received in exchange for an honest review*",5.0

He touched many people's lives, and no one probably even considers it. A five star book I am loaning to my mother, who is a devout Catholic and probably loves the Pope more than me sometimes!

Brown brings 10th century Iceland vividly to life - her descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of the time are wonderful. Her characters are compelling and the plot surges along. Well done.My only issue with the book is the very poor job of conversion to Kindle format. The formatting is all ahooey, which is very distracting. It can be a challenge to figure out where in time we are as the sub headings are not clearly marked out.

The fact it was about so much more than sex, and how sex was more than just something to enjoy, how it can be used as a weapon to deal with demons deep inside, it was all so emotionally revealing. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the way the author structured her sentences/her flow structure of them, but she more than makes up for it with the way she crafts her erotic scenes that will have you wondering if you should read the book anywhere other than in private.CAUTION: This book is only for those who are open with their sexuality and comfortable discussing subjects that are often considered taboo.",4.0

6712,"Facing one's sin and relying on God's grace not to repeat that sin is one of the major themes of Tamara Leigh's Lady of Eve. A clean-read rewrite of one of her first secular best sellers, the book is a sequel to Lady at Arms. It involves the brother of Lady Lizanne Balmaine Wardieu, Gilbert, and the unwanted, unloved Lady Graeye Charwyke--a woman with a birthmark that her mentally unbalanced father considers the mark of the devil. Sent to a convent at age seven, Graeye is about to take her final vows as a nun when God sends a very unusual answer to her prayers. She knows that life in a nunnery is not the calling of the Lord in her life, and she impulsively  makes an errant choice to insure she can never go back. Graeye is no sooner settled into her home than she is ordered back to the convent by her father's enemy Gilbert Balmaine to resume the calling thrust upon her once more. Graeye and Gilbert's story of overcoming prejudice and hatred with faithful love and patience is tastefully done, and is one of action and intrigue.

There was a lot of editing errors that really needed to be fixed, simple things as spelling should not be an issue with a book that has been published.

Some could call this book a romance. Some could call it a twisted connection between two broken people. Whatever it is, it&#8217;s fantastic.

6725,"Pastor John Hagee writes, &#8220;something is about to change,&#8221; the subtitle of his new book, Four Blood Moons. He explores the supernatural connection between the sun, moon and stars, several Jewish Feasts and NASA&#8217;s discovery of four blood moons known as &#8220;Tetrads.&#8221; He writes about the Tetrad&#8217;s appearances, April 15 & Oct 8, 2014 and April 4 & Sept 28, 2015 and their meanings, in addition to the meaning of the complete solar eclipse on March 20, 2015.Hagee begins with his 2012 arrival in Puyallup, WA to speak at Night to Honor Israel, sponsored by Pastor Mark Biltz of El Shaddai Ministries and Christians United for Israel. Biltz asked if he had ever studied &#8220;&#8230;the sun, moon and stars as a source of prophetic revelation?&#8221;  When Hagee said he hadn&#8217;t Biltz explained why he believed the skies were God&#8217;s method of speaking to the world although he believed &#8220;no one was listening.&#8221;When Hagee returned home he began his research with Gen. 1:14 where God said the &#8220;lights in the heavens were to divide the day and night; and let them be for signs and seasons.&#8221; The Hebrew word for &#8220;sign&#8221; also translates as &#8220;signal.&#8221;Joel 2: 31 in the Old Testament and Acts 2:20 in the New Testament both say, &#8220;The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the&#8230;coming of the Lord.&#8221; Was Biltz correct, was &#8220;God using signs in the heavens&#8230;&#8221; to announce coming events?Hagee knew the Bible said, &#8220;There will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars and on the earth distress of nations, Arab Spring with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring.&#8221; Luke 21: 25 at the &#8220;Coming of the Son of Man.&#8221; Was Jesus&#8217; return on the horizon? Was NASA&#8217;s discovery of the four blood moons evidence of the Rapture or Christ&#8217;s return?Could it be America wasn&#8217;t listening when Hurricane Katrina the Oklahoma Tornados or Hurricane Sandy struck? Or the ten-thousand ton meteor that exploded over Russia February 2013? Was that God&#8217;s &#8220;high-definition&#8221; billboard in action?Hagee answers these questions and more in three sections of his new book titled: Signs in the Heavens, the Spine of Prophecy and the Four Blood Moons. In the first segment Hagee teaches why Israel is important to the world, the blessings for those who support Israel, why &#8220;warning comes before judgment,&#8221; meaning of blood moon Tetrad&#8217;s, the Shemittah year and why he believes America is under Judgment and much more.In the Spine of Prophecy, Hagee compares the vertebrae that connect the skull to the tailbone to the backbone of Spinal Prophecy. If prophecy becomes distorted, spiritual distortion occurs in the same manner as vertebrae&#8217;s out of alignment cause pain. This section also covers the Rapture, wars, and rumors of wars, God&#8217;s timing, famines, earthquakes, anarchy and the Gospel message of salvation.The final part concerns the four blood moons of the past, present and future, the meanings behind solar and lunar eclipses and how two Feasts, Passover and Sukkot, relate to NASA&#8217;s forecast of the blood moons. Hagee writes, &#8220;It is very rare that Scripture, science, and historical events align with one another, yet the last three Four Blood Moon series, or Tetrad&#8217;s have done exactly that.&#8221;These events happened three times in the past 500 years and are scheduled to happen again next year and the year after. Hagee asks, &#8220;&#8230;are we listening?&#8221;Pastor Hagee, Bible scholar, world-renowned pastor and preacher&#8217;s new book is a must read for anyone interested in prophecy and End-Time events. The implications are clear. Something is about to happen, however are we listening?",5.0

Son of a b****.&#8221;With the exception of a few editorial bits (that I hope they fix before the publish/release date), I very much enjoyed this book.  I think I would have enjoyed it more had I read the first four books. It would have given me more of a vested interest in the characters, so as a standalone book, I think it&#8217;s not quite as good. But I do wish to read the other books eventually.Tatiana is a pretty self-sufficient woman, and this makes me like her immensely. She&#8217;s a half-breed of human and Amoveo &#8212; a shape shifting breed. Her clan is that of the wolf (and a lot of this seems to link back to Native American legend, or at least it sounds it, due to the names and such. Not gonna lie, I kind of love that.) Due to her Amoveo bloodlines, she is able to empathize with animals, making her an extraordinary vet.  The empathy is what has her coming out to a place that she never wished to travel to, or even recognize as a part of her ancestry.  The horses of the Prince and his family are sick and, at her sister&#8217;s insistence, she makes the drive out.Arriving with her assistant, she is immediately tackled to the ground &#8212; by the one man who she&#8217;s been hiding from in the dream realm (and in the physical world) &#8212; her mate, Dominic.From that first meeting, there is a chemistry and a pull that they can&#8217;t resist, much as they both want to.  They hurt each other, they fend for their lives, and learn to compromise and open up themselves.A lot of this sounds cliche, and it probably is, but I did enjoy the book. Again, I wish I had read the first four before reading this one, as I feel I would have felt more of a connection. I picked the book up, put it down, only to pick it back up again about 10 minutes later.  After the holiday craziness, I plan to buy the other four and delve into those.So, if you&#8217;re already an Amoveo fan, I believe you&#8217;ll enjoy this book immensely.

And he was, to an extent.  But it soon didn't matter as the suspense mounted and I was furiously turning pages.I do note that this is more of a thriller than a mystery.  The author tells the story from several points of view, including the criminal.  So the suspense is in seeing how all these threads will come together and if and how the police will prevail. Four stars instead of five only because I reserve the five star ratings for more substantive genres. But, In the genre of thrillers, you can't do any better.",4.0

I know I'll be gradually running it because I'll be using it so much.Secondly, I've found Ruby's recipes overall to be basically infallible. Though I clearly haven't made all of the recipes because I just received it yesterday, a few of these recipes are already beloved in my house.Third, the concept is so useful, and the recipes really hold true: I can see every single one of the recipes fitting into my weeknight routine (and being a vast improvement).",5.0
6747,"When I was studying magic my instructor mentioned that every one has a different view of the invisible universe, althoughit is like concentrating on one facet of a multifaceted stone .  Dr. Harkness certainly is entitled to her own view of the invisible universe, although it is certainly an unusual one.  She classifies the three types of Homo exceptus as witches , demons and vampires, about which she spins her most interesting story.  Her witches have abilities that are apparently inherited in the female line.  While there is at least one male witch in the line, he does not seem to be as wholesome as the female witches.  The demons all seem to be interesting, and any number of historical characters are classed as demons, post-diction I'm sure.  Personally,  I have found most demons and goblins to be dumb as rocks.  (Let us recall that Christ said, &#34;The stones shall speak to you)  The vampires she has more accurately than most prior writers, as they do go out in the sun light, do not get destroyed by the sun, and can eat (a little) beside drinking blood.As to her story, I enjoyed reading it.  Saying that, I must add that I did not enjoy it enough to purchase the next two books in the trilogy.I do hope she finds a way to give her female lead the alchemical potent which will extend her life for at least several hundred years.  If she is going to marry an almost immortal vampire, she deserves more time with him.",4.0

Once again the LINES are AMAZING. This author KNOWS HOW to write a cliffy. I can't say enough about this author or her books. There have been so many amazing reviews for it already.

6751,"Michael Cuneo's ONE LAST KISS is the story of Chris Coleman, a man who strangled his wife, Sheri, and his two young sons, Garett and Gavin, in the early morning hours in the family home on May 5, 2009, in Columbia, IL, a suburb across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Coleman, head of security for Joyce Meyer Ministries and among the most soulless and heartless atrocities you will ever hear about was involved in a heated love affair with Tara Lintz a high school friend of Sheri's, and the two had exchanged rings and a vow to be married as soon as Coleman was divorced. But Coleman feared that based on company policy, a divorce would mean he would be fired, and Lintz had given him a deadline of May 4 to file for the divorce. He lied to Lintz that he had filed on May 4, and proceeded to kill his family the very next day, clumsily attempting to make it appear that the killings were done by a maniac who despised him for his position with the Ministry, an attempt he had been setting up for six months by sending anonymous letters and e-mails to both the ministry and to himself threatening harm to his family. And to enhance the plot, after he killed his wife and sons, he spray painted obscenities around his house. His attempts to cover up his crime were so inept that no one in the region - the public or the cops - had any doubt after the first couple of days that Coleman was responsible.The story is an unimaginable and profoundly interesting one and the writer, Cuneo, has commendably done a lot of research and presents considerable background on the principals, which is unfortunately one of the few positives about the book. Cuneo had the chance here to produce an intelligent and reportorial study of the case. He did not. Rather he has written a chatty, breezy mediocrity replete with filler, repetition, fabrication, and a nauseating and never-ending lionization of police, lawyers, and judges.Some selected of many possible examples:For just plain sloppiness, consider that Cuneo states that at the time of Coleman's trial, Illinois was ""experiencing its worst hurricane season in recent memory."" I live in St. Louis, and can state without fear of contradiction that there has never ever been a hurricane in this region.And on more than one occasion, he presents incorrect time frames. As noted, the murders were committed on May 5th, 2009, the reason being Coleman's narcissistic desire to be with Tara Lintz while losing nothing more than a family which was now a hindrance. On page 311, Cuneo writes that Coleman became infatuated with Lintz in the fall of 2009 and began implementing his plan and cover up in November 2009. If this were the case, Coleman would have murdered his family 5 months before falling for Lintz.The same thing happens when we learn that Sheri was born in 1977 and her brother Mario in 1975.  According to Cuneo, the family moved to Largo, FL, in 1978, at which time Sheri and Mario were 12 and 10 respectively. Unless the siblings suffered from progeria, a condition conspicuously absent from the narrative, this seems unlikely, and all I can say is, ""Nice editing.""Repetition is rampant. Cuneo in the first chapter reports the findings, emotions, and preliminary observations of the cops and EMTs who are the first responders to the crime scene.  Later, in a particularly cynical example of increasing his page count at the expense of quality, Cuneo has two officers repeating this information to a later arrival at the scene. He could have simply written that ""they made the later arrival aware of their findings."" But no, he repeats the information.There is a discrepancy in time frames that is important to solving the case. Cuneo reports and explains this discrepancy at least three times.Cuneo is also omniscient. On pg. 134, he reports that Sheri applied steroid cream to Gavin's poison ivy. Besides being a prime example of irrelevant filler, my question is, with Sheri and the boys being dead when the book was written, how would he possibly know this and why would we care in any case?Cuneo reports on numerous instances of interaction - thoughts and conversations - between Coleman and his family. It is obvious that they didn't cooperate with the author in writing the book. He simply makes things up as he goes along.Reporting on Coleman's being interviewed by police, Cuneo reports him as ""sounding like a petulant nine-year-old accused by his parents of stealing from the cookie jar.""A child, ""Austin saw the look in his mom's eyes. He knew that she was telling him the truth."" Give me a break! Fabricated, not to mention bad, similes and true crime don't go together. He should be writing soap opera.As for Cuneo's fawning idolization of almost everyone in the book other then Coleman's family and a few others:""Hadn't (Chief Edwards) always encouraged the people working under him to go that extra step in solving crimes?""""At State's Attorney Kris Reitz's skillful prompting, the chief described the reams of evidence that the police had uncovered..."" How skillful does a prosecutor have to be to introduce prosecution evidence from a cop? But then Cuneo is incapable of not lavishing praise on that which is actually mundane.""Judge Wharton proved a master of reasonable compromise.""Sheriff Kelly is ""delightfully frank and witty.""Kris ""Reitz was sharp, confident and single minded."" He also ""wanted a conviction in the case..."" Maybe I'm jaded, but Reitz's desired outcome would seem to go without saying, him being a prosecutor and all. Keep that word count rolling!John O'Gara, ""positively oozed compassion and humanity."" And while this would make me personally not want to sit too close to him, we are also advised that, ""He had a slightly shambling look about him that nicely understated his sharpness of intellect.""""Baden was lucid and congenial.""Even a local TV anchor and cameraman are described as being ""talented"" and an ""ace"" respectively.And finally, even the title, ONE LAST KISS, is nothing but soap opera, there being no way of knowing whether or not Coleman gave his family members a ""last kiss"" before killing them.I read another book by Cuneo called ALMOST MIDNIGHT. It was very good, professional and reportorial, so he is certainly capable of better, but here he has taken an interesting story that could provide a writer intent on doing an intelligent job with maybe 200 pages of material and turned it into a fictional/semi-true crime/soap opera crapfest. It has long been my contention that in the best of true crime, the reader is unaware of the author's personality until he's through with the book and then marvels at what a fine job he's done. In ALMOST MIDNIGHT, Cuneo is omnipresent on every page.",2.0

6755,"White Hot Kiss by Jennifer L. ArmentroutSteph's Rating: 5 starsDani's Rating: 5 starsOverall: 5 starsReview:WOW. I whizzed through this book over the course of a few hours, and I can't say enough that I love, love, LOVE this book! White Hot Kiss is your standard witty JLA book, and while some people might get tired of her formula-like writing, I personally love the versatile equation she came up with and I know her book will not disappoint, every time. This is a fantastic series debut for Jen, and it's one of the best &#34;first books&#34; she's ever come up with!Layla is a defect amongst the Warden race, in fact, she's pretty much cursed. Born as half demon, half of the mortal enemy of the Wardens, she hasn't earned many fans even within the Warden clan she's been raised in since a kid. It doesn't help her that getting too close could mean getting your soul whisked away, no thanks to her demon side. She doesn't fit in nicely into a category--not human, fully demon, or Warden. The only thing she has are her special abilities that are enough for the Wardens to keep her around. But when she meets Roth, a powerful Upper-Level demon, she starts questioning everything she has been taught to believe by her upbringers. She learns the truth behind her bloodline...and the fact that she may be in the eye of a demon coup.I just don't even know what to say. WHK is just so Jen. The humor, the references, and the phenomenal characters; all of the usual Jen characteristics are throughout this book, and every single one fits in perfectly. There is just the right amount of intensity fueling the story to make you feel uber excited for the rest of the series, but not so much that you feel burned out after just book one. I think WHK is really showing Jen's progression into a master storyteller, and this book was definitely worth it's wait.Oh deary Roth. I'm so sorry Daemon, but Roth is my new fave Jen-boy. This bad boy demon is unfairly--yes, best put, sinfully--hot. And he's so charismatic that you can't even question not being drawn to him. Roth is an amped up Daemon in a way, but I liked Roth the moment I met him. With Daemon, he had a book of being a kinda-sorta-but-still-hot douche, so Roth is in the lead. I mean, if this is just the beginning? I CAN'T WAIT to see how Roth's character is going to develop throughout the series. He's really perfect for Layla, who's been so governed by rules her whole life. Layla needs someone to make her feel special for once instead of a birth defect, and Roth provides all of the above.Usually you don't think of sexy when you think of gargoyles...but as always, Jen knows what she's doing and exactly what she wants to deliver. I'm pretty sure people are going to give the eyebrow when they read the synopsis and think of the stone sculptures on the sides of buildings, but I can assure that this isn't anywhere near that. I am so in love with this concept, and its just such an original voice out there. I think these not-so-stony gargoyles might be it for me among all of Jen's books so far!What would a JLA book be without the jaw-dropping twisty-twists? There will be lots of bomb dropping and explosions all the way through the book, so my normal Jen advice--Brace yourselves. Especially for the ending. ;)I'm onto my second read of White Hot Kiss--in fact I basically just read the last page and flipped right back to the beginning. Like all of her books, here is some real quality that you can read over and over again as many times as you want, and you still won't find yourself sick of any moment of it. I just did a fast read-over of WHK so I could get out this review (we know, we've been quiet for the past week), and now I'll go do my in-depth read. Can't wait for Stone Cold Touch this November--whose cover reveal will be here [A Walk on Words] soon!--Steph and Dani @ A Walk on Words",5.0

6759,"This was such a wonderful book. I fell in love with Cami and Stockton at the very beginning and knew they would make a great couple. Their relationship develops slowly and we're able to really watch them fall in love. And both are great characters. Actually, with the exception of Cami's parents and sister, all of the characters in this book are good. Stockton's sister Will is especially sweet.Cami pushes her parents too far in an attempt to try and get some kind of attention from them. They're from Beverly Hills and are too wrapped up in themselves to notice her. Their solution is to send her to her aunt and uncles in Tennessee. This turns out to be the best turn of events in her life. She meets Stockton. At first, they're snide and snappy with each other but you know it's because they are attracted to one another. When Cami becomes friends with Will, she's asks Stockton to  be nice and try to be friends. Once they begin to spend time together, these two souls, both with broken pasts, begin to heal.Great love story.

6763,"I found my copy of this book on the discard shelf at my local YMCA, never having heard of it. It had been in some library system somewhere and they had placed a label that said &#34;discard&#34;on the back cover. Well, that was my good fortune. I hardly ever read novels anymore, but something about this book drew me in. I could really identify with it and with the characters. The way Kevin Wilson gets into their thought processes is very real. All of the writing is that way. I wanted to read every word and savored the book. I didn't want it to end.Few people have parents who are performance artists, but everyone deals with the same issues this family does. What does it mean to be truly independent? How do we judge our parents for what they have given us, good and bad? How do people move beyond their lifelong programming and reconcile with the past? At the same time, the book is very funny, and I found myself laughing out loud more than once.

Annnnnd repeat. It was beyond irritating.I don't have much else to say about this book. I was going to list all the ways in which the book was disappointing, but I got tired just thinking about it.

But then her younger sister Nicole joins the clique.  And then Nicole gets killed.  And Toni and Ryan are convicted of murder.This book gets off to a painfully slow start, to the point where I don&#8217;t know that &#8220;tedious&#8221; really does it justice.  Lots of time is spent on depictions of a Toni as an unruly teenage girl.  Sex, drugs, and alcohol become repetitive to the point where it&#8217;s unclear whether the author is making a point, or advocating them.  Emotions and feelings are described for pages and pages while nothing is really happening.  Granted, you need to spend some time setting up the background, and establishing characters&#8217; motives and frame of mind, but you could easily skip the first half of the book and not miss much.Toni is well fleshed-out as whiny, obnoxious, and totally unsympathetic; traits not normally satisfying in a lead character outside of a tale of redemption.  Her boyfriend, Ryan, has a bad reputation but aside from getting stoned a lot he&#8217;s repeatedly shown to have the proverbial heart of gold.  The rest of the cast are mostly stereotypes plucked from your choice of rebellious teen movies.The action appears in fits and starts, although things start to get interesting near the end.  When you finally find out who-dunnit though, it&#8217;s pretty unbelievable.This may succeed as women&#8217;s literature, but it&#8217;s advertised as a &#8220;Blockbuster Thriller&#8221;, and in that genre it&#8217;s a total failure.

Noble works for the Labor Commission and now Caroline works for them.

He&#8217;s trying to learn the family business and figure out ways to make the factory better by working as a laborer in the factory himself and he doesn&#8217;t want his true identity revealed.Gordon Hightower is the factory manager. Mr. Dinsmore plucked him out of orphanage when he was a boy and gave him a &#8220;better&#8221; life working in the factory.

Letta is determined to provide for her family &#8211; whatever it takes. Caroline befriends the girl and becomes attached to the trio of children. But they have a hard time trusting anyone.As I said, there is a lot going on here, but the story is woven together very well. Each has their own story to tell and somehow they all blend together. I felt that the characters were intelligent and interesting. They were realistic and not stupid &#8211; which is something that always gets me in these types of novels.

6792,"&#34;The Making of a Prophet&#34; is a short, but very deep book (174 pages). It helps awaken a potential prophet no matter where they find themselves, such as within performance-driven ministries or in the midst of their wilderness experiences. It teaches about what is likely to happen during the making process of a prophet&#8230;.from waiting periods between the calling and the anointing, to the potter&#8217;s wheel process, to training experiences, to walking out the prophetic anointing in love to make Jesus (Yeshua) and God&#8217;s Kingdom purposes bigger and the prophet smaller.There are warnings to readers to be sure people are being called into the prophecy vocation and teaches about different kinds of prophets. Most people who have accepted Jesus (Yeshua) into their hearts are probably prophets in some kind of way(s) but some people move into a prophetic vocation. These people really need to count the cost because the cost will be high&#8230;possibly leaving what they are used to and people they are used to being with, enduring spiritual warfare, and the cost of not delivering messages from God to people He wants them spoken to.Learning that being a prophet will bring much spiritual warfare was something I hadn&#8217;t really taken in before and I&#8217;m glad it was emphasized in this book. It also showed me how to notice false or immature prophets better; sometimes they want special titles and want a lot of credit when a prophecy comes true. Also, it made me more aware of some of the different prophetic callings and that competition in the prophetic vocation is a sign of immaturity. And, when I feel like holding onto a ministry assignment that I understand and have to let go of and possibly leave the place where I am involved with that assignment at I should &#8220;&#8230;Remember, the old thing serves as a foundation for the new thing God is calling you to do-and you cannot usually do both at the same time.&#8221; Page 144Most importantly, the following quote helped me to understand better that if prophets do not prophecy out of love their message probably will not have much meaning to the people it is delivered to. &#8220;Without intimacy with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you cannot prophesy what is on His heart with consistent accuracy. And if prophesy is not coming from the heart of our loving God-and if it is not delivered in that spirit of love, even when giving a call to repentance &#8211;then it is best left unspoken because it is not truly representing God. We are always supposed to speak the truth in love (see Ephesians 4:15).&#8221; Pg 45Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary book from Chosen Books  for this review.

6815,"I've read a lot of Marvel trade collections/omnibuses since the Avengers film came out. I've worked my way throughAvengers Disassembled,House of M,Civil War,Secret InvasionandSiege- along with some of Thor's solo trades, the New Avengers, Mighty Avengers, and Journey into Mystery. And, this is the best book I have read of them all.After coming across Fury's Secret Warrior's team a few times within the crossover event tie-ins, I decided to pick up this omnibus on impulse when I found it at a huge discount.  I never expected it to be such an exciting, well written, convoluted and engrossing conspiracy thriller! I burned through all 900+ pages in two nights and not because the material is light. I simply could not put it down.  And apart from Captain America appearing a couple of times at the end, none of the more familiar all-star heroes take part.  It's all Nick Fury, the Howling Commandos, and his ""caterpillars"".When Fury gets wind of Secret Invasion, and that many allies and heroes might not be who they say (or think) they are, he decides to build a new team of heroes from potential metahuman candidates, the caterpillars.  Daisy ""Quake"" Johnson leads the inaugural team which includes a child god, a mystic, a strongman, a speedster and a grandson of a Ghost Rider.  But the book goes far beyond what this one team is working on when Fury learns that Hydra has infiltrated SHIELD and every major corporation around the globe (It's all connected!).  And then the Leviathon organization enters the fray.  The way the plot plays out is BRILLIANT.  There is a lot of action, sometimes with deadly consequences, but also plans within plans.  I found myself cheering by the end, it was so well played.Overall, I cannot recommend this book enough. In fact, if you read only one graphic novel ever, be sure it's this one. Yes, it's that good. Highly recommended.",5.0

When his grandfather dies, Devin knows he is unable to do it all himself. He heads to the city  to seek help but is unprepared for what he finds there. It is a sad and cruel place for the many abandoned children who are forced to survive any way they can. When he is told about a safe place, a wonderful place, for exceptional children, he agrees to go as long as his new friend, Kit, can come.When they arrive at the Gabriel H. Penn Home for Childhood, at first, it seems perfect. There's lots of food, playthings, animals, and other children. But something just doesn't seem right. The children, despite all this plenty, seem sad and subdued...except for a couple whose behaviour seems very odd. When Kay exhibits this strange behaviour, Devin is determined to discover what is behind it. But now it seems, it's his turn and the Director has something very special planned for him.Author Tania Unsworth has drawn a dark and disturbing near-future in her novel, The One safe Place, aimed at a YA audience but with enough suspense and creep-factor to satisfy an adult audience.  The children are, for the most part, well-drawn, eccentric, and sympathetic and, although it seems like there isn't a nice adult anywhere outside of the farm, this actually works within the confines of the story. The tale gripped me from the beginning and kept me enthralled until the very satisfying end. Nice debut from Unsworth - I look forward to reading more from her in the future albeit hopefully not the future depicted in her novel.",4.0

It does not tell the barest of endings, but instead it tells what happens after the mystery is solved. I really liked that. When I come to admire the characters in a book, I hate to have them whisked away abruptly by just a &#34;so and so did it, the end.&#34; I was happy that did not happen here. This story was excellent. It was very descriptive, complex and complete. Ms. Marks weaved the mystery in and out, giving the reader plenty so suspects to choose from. There was ample information on sleazy characters to give several the motive, means and opportunity for murder. It was also very exciting, with lots of &#34;close calls&#34;, but best of all were the great sleuthing skills the main character possessed. I loved the fact she is a quilter, and of course has such loyal close quilting friends. It was also great to read of the flirting, and budding romance for her as well. These characters are well developed. I am so disappointed that I have to wait until November for the next book. I've read many cozy mysteries.....I've come to think of them as light, not as in depth, and quick to figure out. This mystery was not at all like that. It was very in depth, long, detailed, exciting, and packed with dangerous situations for the main character. Really looking forward to the second book.

Forgiveness is universal, but people can still make themselves damned miserable.Ben would be perfectly happy to be dead if he could just find his beloved wife Marian &#8211; after all, he committed suicide to be with her again after her untimely, accidental death. But in spite of all the resources for finding the ones you&#8217;ve loved and lost and are looking for &#8211; everything from relatives (including in-laws) to Human Resources&#8217; computer records, and a private eye who bursts into uncontrollable giggles any time he hears a lie &#8211; Ben is striking out. What has become of Marian?Ben&#8217;s quest is complicated by encounters with other souls: Robert, who has been obsessively waiting outside the processing area for arriving souls for ten years; a former girlfriend who shows him how to almost fly; and a man who is not quite dead, but coma status is close enough to let him spend time in the Other World.  Each of these souls makes different choices, showing us, and Ben, not only the scope of free will, but how we impose limits and force our version of reality on the world.Ben never knew it, but someone had fallen in love with him during that final year of his life. Her story is also told, and it is even more bizarre than Ben&#8217;s, fraught with humor, horror, pathos, mistaken identities, and bad timing.  And throughout the double narrative a mystery unfolds, as two souls try to find each other across an abyss bridged by the internet and a shared passion for the literature of Salman Rushdie.Gafla&#8217;s writing style is somewhat like Fforbes wonderful Thursday Next series.

6847,"Never has one book packed so much between its covers or had such a huge impact on my future reading. Ms. Frost&#8217;s books are always a must read for me. With MAGIC GRAVES I&#8217;ve been introduces to the writings of Ilona Andrews and I am counting myself the luckiest reader in the world to have discover her. Since both Ms. Frost and Ms. Andrews have novellas and excerpts from some of their other work I&#8217;m going to take them one at a time. Just a note here before I do. Both novellas included in MAGIC GRAVES are important to their respective series and should not be missed.I&#8217;m going to begin with Ms. Frost&#8217;s contribution to this book. Her novella is titled ONE FOR THE MONEY. A classic Cat and Bones story filled with wit, danger and nooky. What should have been a simple assignment turns into one of the closest calls Cat encounters in her many adventures of flirting with death. Take a spoiled-rich college girl that needs protection, add Cat&#8217;s mom Justina holed up in the same house as Bones and you have a recipe for disaster. Thing is, the danger comes from an entirely unexpected source. Fantastic read!As an added bonus to ONE FOR THE MONEY there are two excerpts included. The first three chapters to HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, a Cat and Bones tale, will hook you and not turn lose until you get your hands on the story. The second excerpt comes from the first novel in the Night Prince Series call ONCE BURNED. This series is going to be about Vlad Tepesh, better known as Dracula. Just don&#8217;t call him that, he hates the title. From the little bit of the story that is shared I can already tell this will be another series by Ms. Frost I&#8217;ll simply have to read. No getting around it.Now on to Ms. Andrews. Thank you to whichever book god that lead me to the discovery of her stories. If you have already read any of her books you will know that I am truly grateful to be able to add her to my list of must read authors. If you&#8217;ve been reading her Kate Daniels series and not read A QUESTIONABLE CLIENT you really should correct that mistake. If you&#8217;ve not been reading the series this will give you a tiny bite into her world and the legion of strange creatures, both human and very non-human, that inhabit her post-apocalyptic Atlanta. Kate is a mercenary with extraordinary skills that takes a bodyguard assignment. To say the client, Saiman, is strange and dangerous would be a monstrous understatement.  I cannot read any of the Kate Daniels books and not crack a smile or chuckle out loud. Can&#8217;t be done. I&#8217;m obsessed with her books.Ms. Andrews has included an excerpt from book three in the Edge Series, FATE&#8217;S EDGE. And yes, this will be one more series I will be starting. The other sneak peek was a rough draft from a novella she was working on at the time. MAGIC GRIEVES will be one more story involving Kate. For a rough draft it was great and as intriguing as all the rest of the books in the series. Looking forward to being able to add it to my library.I can easily give this my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION to anyone over the age of 18.",5.0

Her high school flame, Cash, is ready and waiting to pick up where they left off, however Ani is unsure if that is what she wants.  Ani still feels an attraction to Cash but then she meets a hunky biker named Knox and the sparks fly! &#34;She had wanted to saddle this man and ride him into the sunset...&#34; the passion and fireworks between Ani and Knox are HOT!!!! Ani is the perfect biker girlfriend in my opinion.  Sassy, strong enough to deal with the chicks that just hang around the clubhouse waiting for a biker to screw and can deal with the lifestyle that comes with being in a MC. Knox has a typical biker, badass attitude that I love as well.  My favorite line of his in this book is &#34;I can't promise you a happy ending, darlin'; but happy endings are for pussies.&#34;  But being in a relationship with a biker is never easy, as Ani soon discovers. There are always risks with being associated with a motorcycle club and Ani is going to be put to the ultimate test of finding out how strong of a woman she really is. Can Ani and Knox's relationship survive? If you love MC club books, this is a must read!**This a &#34;to be continued&#34; book, however it is not a huge cliffhanger that will piss you off.

In Blood and Fire, Rayvin awaits for help from the Counselor to destroy De Sade and free those he has turned. There are so many things happening in this book. Almost like 4 different stories being told simultaneously then merging into one climactic ending. I don't want to give too much away because there is so much going on. The only thing that got me about this book and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of more was because there were times that it just seemed to drag on. It would recount things that happened in the last book to the most minute detail...almost as if you were reading it all over again, but you had to remind yourself this is the sequel.

6863,"His most important claim is the radical Platonist view that all well-defined mathematical structures exist, therefore most physics is the study of which of those we inhabit. His arguments are more tempting than any others I've seen for this view, but I'm left with plenty of doubt.He points to ways that we can imagine this hypothesis being testable, such as via the fine-tuning of fundamental constants. But he doesn't provide a good reason to think that those tests will distinguish his hypothesis from other popular approaches, as it's easy to imagine that we'll never find situations where they make different predictions.The most valuable parts of the book involve the claim that the multiverse is spatially infinite. He mostly talks as if that's likely to be true, but his explanations caused me to lower my probability estimate for that claim.He gets that infinity by claiming that inflation continues in places for infinite time, and then claiming there are reference frames for which that infinite time is located in a spatial rather than a time direction. I have a vague intuition why that second step might be right (but I'm fairly sure he left something important out of the explanation).For the infinite time part, I'm stuck with relying on argument from authority, without much evidence that the relevant authorities have much confidence in the claim.Toward the end of the book he mentions reasons to doubt infinities in physics theories - it's easy to find examples where we model substances such as air as infinitely divisible, when we know that at some levels of detail atomic theory is more accurate. The eternal inflation theory depends on an infinitely expandable space which we can easily imagine is only an approximation. Plus, when physicists explicitly ask whether the universe will last forever, they don't seem very confident. I'm also tempted to say that the measure problem (i.e. the absence of a way to say some events are more likely than others if they all happen an infinite number of times) is a reason to doubt infinities, but I don't have much confidence that reality obeys my desire for it to be comprehensible.I'm disappointed by his claim that we can get good evidence that we're not Boltzmann brains. He wants us to test our memories, because if I am a Boltzmann brain I'll probably have a bunch of absurd memories. But suppose I remember having done that test in the past few minutes. The Boltzmann brain hypothesis suggests it's much more likely for me to have randomly acquired the memory of having passed the test than for me to actually be have done the test. Maybe there's a way to turn Tegmark's argument into something rigorous, but it isn't obvious.He gives a surprising argument that the differences between the Everett and Copenhagen interpretations of quantum mechanics don't matter much, because unrelated reasons involving multiverses lead us to expect results comparable to the Everett interpretation even if the Copenhagen interpretation is correct.It's a bit hard to figure out what the book's target audience is - he hides the few equations he uses in footnotes to make it look easy for laymen to follow, but he also discusses hard concepts such as universes with more than one time dimension with little attempt to prepare laymen for them.The first few chapters are intended for readers with little knowledge of physics. One theme is a historical trend which he mostly describes as expanding our estimate of how big reality is. But the evidence he provides only tells us that the lower bounds that people give keep increasing. Looking at the upper bound (typically infinity) makes that trend look less interesting.The book has many interesting digressions such as a description of how to build Douglas Adams' infinite improbability drive.",4.0

6874,"I received a copy of this book free of charge from the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.I think it was a hard undertaking for the author to tackle this subject just because there is not much written in Scripture about Mary of Bethany. I have always been fascinated by Mary of Bethany and her faith and this is what drew me to this title. I appreciate the authors effort but this was just not what I expected. It was not entirely bad. It just had much more added that had nothing much to do with the topic specifically of Mary of Bethany and her mystery. Yet again, there is not much written about her in Scripture so I should have realized this before picking the book up.The author explores all the Scripture where Mary of Bethany is mentioned. There is then a lot of information that may or may not relate to those texts specifically. There was one specific section that discussed prayer and was critical of some other Christian authors that I was uncomfortable with. Yet then later there was a big emphasis on grace and the cross. I just got mixed messages and really tried to like this title but it fell short.

6878,"The premise of David and Goliath:  Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants is enwrapped within the brief synopsis of the legendary tale of David and Goliath.  And from there Malcolm Gladwell takes greater importance of the tale and how it relates to everyday occurrences and never underestimate the unexpected.  The subtitle of the book basically describes what Gladwell speaks of, from the over achievers to the under achievers or anyone in the middle, this book may appeal to curious that may want to see how effectiveness can be fulfilled when options are available, i.e. there are two ways to approach and look at things when choices have to be made.  And questions may arise, such as how much is needed to achieve the results and does perception play a role?Gladwell examines several scenarios within nine chapters that are not at all separate from each but parallel and draw from each one - he emphasizes the aspect of relationships and comparisons that show similar outcomes.  What readers may find common in the scenarios in which he writes about involve organization within competitive environments and team settings.  This is displayed in the first section called ""The Advantages of Disadvantages (And the Disadvantages of Advantages), which discusses three interesting stories.  First, activities in the classroom and in teaching and the important factor that size matters, second, the art of team playing on the basketball court and where the underdogs shine through by two important elements, common sense and the window of opportunity, and the third example, what every high school junior must decide and eventually see the results by the time they arrive to the college of their choice.  Caroline Sacks surprises herself as well as finds out who she really is and what she wants to be in terms of her personal development and professional career path after experiencing the ""Big Fish-Little Pond Effect.""  The other sections of the book further elaborates upon scenarios of surprise or unexpected moments that individuals have encountered in their life ""The Desirable of Difficulty"" or the ""I never thought he would amount to anything"" scenarios because of early pitfalls and disappoints.  This is the case with David Boies who had grown up with dyslexia all of his life but later became a trial lawyer and Gary Cohn who became very successful in Wall Street.  They were able to successfully overcome this hindrance through not so obvious means from enhanced listening skills to acting as the class clown. And Gladwell's book would not be complete without a scenario from the historic past and the London Blitz and Emil ""Jay"" Freireich's story and the courage of sense - and things are not always what they seem in particular uncompromising circumstances.  This may also be shown in the concluding story of this section with the iconic photograph of Wyatt Walker and the tumultuous period of 1963 that parallels with the tale of Brer Rabbit and the moral to each of these examples.After reading David and Goliath there may be a better understanding of the choices that one may makes.  And with the examples that have been discussed in the book, one thing is most certain that the first choice does not always ends up as the last choice.",4.0

She left town after graduation from high school and received a letter a few weeks later from her sister that was dated 1975. Maybe the class of 1972 thing was a typo. It was hardly enough to cause me to go flipping back through the pages to read it again to make sure. The book has great surprises in it, but some disappointments in character development. But then again, this author has a published book, and I do not. All I can say is that I read often and southern fiction is my favorite.

Only 3 3/4 stars.Allie is a very troubled teen.  She is convinced that her cousin Maddie died because of her inability to rescue her or stop her from going into danger.  Maddie fell in a river as Allie was chasing her to get her to stop.  Just when Allie had Maddie within her grasp, Allie went under and released her hold on Maddie and she, Maddie, drowned.  This caused a deep rooted phobia of water since that day.  Present day, Allie's father is forcing her on a family boat outing with friends Brooke and Aaron and step brother Nick. Allie can't get on the boat so Aaron hauls her up over his shoulder and hops on the boat. As the afternoon wears on Allie falls against her step brother Nick, who resents her, and he shoves her hard off him, hard enough that she lands in the water.  Aaron rescues her.  Allie has it out with her Dad blaming him for forcing her to go on this outing.  So what do we have in this pot? We have Aaron secretly longing for Allie, yet he flirts with and leads Brooke on.  We have Nicky and Allie, step siblings who hate each other.  Allie's friend Brooke adores Aaron and is quite the blabbermouth. The mysterious Damien appears with his secretive past, who Allie falls in love with. Nice set up for an interesting summer camp vacation.

6903,"Small Spiders, by J.T. Conroe is a political story told from a unique prospective.  The author takes us back to the years of President Nixon, Watergate, and various other plots that occurred out of the public eye.  Some of the characters are fictional, but the events are a part of history.  Mark David Chapman, Arthur Bremer, James Earl Ray, Sirhan Sirhan are some familiar names.  What is not known is what, or rather who, was really responsible for their actions.Michele Clark is a reporter determined to expose government corruption.  The story is told from a narrator&#8217;s point of view; although it takes a while to realize the identity of the person.  Corruption travels to the very top government level with twists and turns in between.  Michele risks her life to uncover a secret operation that revolves around assassins and every time she gets close, she is shut down.  Follow Michelle as she goes above and beyond reporting and begins to investigate areas that are better left alone.  Samantha is a pretty blond, Artie is an innocent pawn, and Dennis seems to have it all.  What is the connection between these three and how do they relate to small spiders?The plot unfolds slowly and surprisingly.  Artie finds himself manipulated to do things and he is totally unaware of his own actions.  Dennis tries to help but they both underestimate Samantha&#8217;s power.  We get a glimpse of the real possibilities behind Watergate, the Kennedy assassinations, murders, and cover-ups.  Michele Clark wanted to tell the truth to the American public about the real dealings behind the scenes and remains determined despite threats to her life.  Everybody seems to have secret connections and there may or may not be any good guys.This is a good look into secret organizations and political corruption designed to give the powerful the desires of their heart.  The average citizen has no idea about the inner workings of political organizations and after reading this book I know that people, situations and even the news are often manipulated to obtain desired results.  I look at politics so differently and I see how easy it is to misplace trust.  I believe that anyone with an interest in politics and history should read this book.  The back of the book also documents a timeline that is very interesting and educational.",5.0
6904,"Surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would with a title like &#34;Seduced by Innocence&#34;.The world building is a bit disappointing. While we did hear about the spells and magicks the witches cast as well as the potion-making and shapeshifting of the Druids, I didn't feel like the story properly set up the worlds and sometimes it felt like the author was either making it up as they went along or expected the reader to already know about the community of either group.The characters are pretty likeable and while they aren't fully developed, you can definitely get a feel for them. Most of the time I didn't look to see whose POV it was (as it switches back and forth between Derek and Rose, with a few chapters in which Blake narrates), but I always knew who was talking because they all have a different style, a different kind of internal monologue, which was pretty cool.In particular, I really enjoyed seeing Blake's internal monologue because it differed so drastically from Derek's and really emphasized what a creep he is. He has this Nice Guy&#8482; sort of feel to him and at first I thought, 'well, maybe Rose is being a little harsh,' but as the book progressed you could see exactly why he made Rose's skin crawl, and while I know the book wasn't written before this, Blake's narration reads eerily similar to the Santa Barbara shooter's manifesto sometimes (especially in a part where he claimed to &#34;deserve&#34; Rose's affections). It was good to finally see a creepy, only nice to get the girl, kind of guy as the bad guy while being juxtaposed to a guy who actually respected Rose.The theme was actually pretty cool.  In each chapter, there is a quote from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and it was interesting to see how the author wove their story to parallel and even challenge that play.  Unlike our R&J;, who are infatuated to the point that they marry in three days and are the cause of six deaths, this book challenges the families and claims that it isn't necessarily that the two main characters are too immature, but that the family cannot let go of past grievances.The sex was well written. I've read my fair share of porn and there's nothing worse than an author being noticeably embarrassed at what they're writing. This author, however, lays it all down, isn't squicked at describing vaginal anatomy and pleasure, and makes each scene (there's only a few, don't worry) enjoyable to read. I really do have to say well done because I'm tired of reading 'his manhood' and 'down there', and, other than a questionable &#34;rose-colored nipples&#34; (are there roses the color of the areola?), this author did it.It's pretty feminist friendly. When Rose sets boundaries, they are always bent by her and not by Derek trying to coerce her. Everything is about consent. While I was pretty worried about that (the book is called Seduced by Innocence and there are several lines in which Derek is aroused by her 'innocence'), it all turned out to be okay.  The Bechdel Test is passed.  There are also a few queer characters and I'm really happy about that, even though only two of them get any sort of recognition.  The lack of people of color is sad, (and the one POC in the novel was stereotypical and kind of racist with the Magic Asian who speaks broken English and runs a martial arts center or whatever) and I'd really rather read a book with a couple nonwhite people, but other than that I was mildly impressed.Of course, the real downer is the ending.  Here's the thing; I like reading fully developed stories.  They must have some sort of resolution; this had none.  I understand it's a first installment, but you can't deliver an unfinished manuscript and call it a first installment.  That's not how it works, and I was disappointed that this author chose that route.",4.0

6908,"Because I'm lazy, I'm going to write one review for all of Amy Cross's books and copy and paste in each (because in the past week I have read quite a bit of her work).  I first came across her when I was searching for free books, and have since read all of hers that are free, as well as purchasing a handful.Now most of the time, if I'm going to take the time to leave a review, it's going to be positive only.  I don't see the need to negatively review something, as I don't like to take money out of small business's pockets (yes, writers are small businesses); and just because I don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't.  But I'm going to be a little critical here, just to address some of the issues I had, as well as some of the issues listed in the reviews of her work left by others.Amy has a great imagination, and she comes up with good stories.  Even when she tiptoes into cliched-fiction-land (vampires, werewolves, zombies) she is able to add her own touch so that it doesn't feel like you're reading the same ol' ""Twilight"" wannabe.But....she does definitely have editing issues.  If she has a ""first reader"" or two, they need to be fired.  As I'm not an english teacher, I'm able to move beyond this for the most part, but sometimes she'll mix-up a name and that can cause confusion.  The other problem is that her stories sometimes are a tad disjointed.  Sometimes it feels like she changes direction midway thru and it can be rather wobbly.All that being said, I do enjoy her work.  I think it's well worth the price charged (if you don't snag any for free).  And again, the only reason I drifted into being critical there was to give a heads up to potential readers in case they're the type of folks who lose their mind over small mistakes.  Amy Cross is a good writer, and I believe she will only get better.",4.0

6910,"Supernatural Hero is a story about Andy, a young boy in sixth grade, and his struggles with trying to be popular. As a nerd, his self esteem is low and his only want and desire in the world is to be with Zoe, the best looking girl in class. When Andy's grandpa dies, he's afraid all is lost. But his grandpa promised he'd help him be with Zoe and his ghost continues to encourage and guide him toward having a chance with Zoe.Andy eventually finds out that he can see more spirits than just his grandfather. This young boy who can't even gather the nerve to talk to Zoe must face all of his fears to save her and her family from a dark, bad spirit. If he prevails, he will prove himself to Zoe and he can be her boyfriend.I love the way this story is written from the perspective of a young boy. His feelings, thoughts, and actions are driven within you in such a way that you can feel the boy's inner most frustrations, fears, and anger. Not a lot of adult writers can pull off this kind of character development.Eran Gadot did an excellent job. The book is well written and edited. The suspense kept me reading from start to finish and certainly didn't disappoint. This is a great story for the whole family.",5.0

6916,"Adam Freeman has provided a tutorial text for AngularJS that surpasses any other instructional materials currently available. First, as is often the case with new and quickly evolving web technologies, tutorials are fragmented across multiple blogs, forums and such, making a comprehensive single publication on AngularJS necessary.  Current comprehensive AngularJS materials (such as the AngularJS official API and Lerner's ng-book) are not accessible to the AngularJS beginner, however.  Assuming you are competent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the problem you'll face immediately after trying the AngularJS &#34;Hello, World&#34; example is the need to create a stack of technologies to really see AngularJS in action. Typically, this might include NodeJS for the server, ExpressJS for routing, MongoDB for data storage, Jade for templating, Stylus and Bootstrap for CSS, unit testing with Karma...the learning curve becomes incredibly steep incredibly fast.  Freeman's text initially uses the simplest technologies available to fashion the web stack in order to focus more thoroughly on AngularJS.  Anyone familiar with Freeman's ASP.NET or MVC texts will be instantly familiar with the SportsStore web application also used in Pro AngularJS.  Following the initial chapters describing the development of the SportsStore web site using Angular, you'll be prepared to proceed to the more advanced aspects of AngularJS described in the latter sections of the book.",5.0

Still, we have a very reasonable heroine, although her reason for being where she is has a few credibility problems.  We have a troubled hero, determined to get what is owed his family, and the bad guys, determined to get what they want, no matter what, convinced that they are the smartest people around.  All set in a (relatively) sexy locale... what it lacks in sex-appeal is somewhat made up for in the author's obvious familiarity with the area, something frequently lacking (I grew up in the general area, and spent one summer working there).The conflict between the hero and heroine was not overdone, and the identity of the actual &#34;bad guys&#34; came as a bit of a surprise.  But the best part of this book was the time-travel, apparently granted to only one character, and granting a totally different ended than could otherwise be accomplished.",4.0
6924,"Sayre Hoyle Lynch returned to the small town of Destiny, Louisiana for her younger brother&#8217;s funeral. Her intention was to attend Danny&#8217;s funeral and immediately catch a flight back to San Francisco where she owned an interior design business. Huff Hoyle, the father, a tough, ruthless man with no moral compass, owned and operated a foundry which was pretty much the only means of employment in the small town. Hoyle had two sons, Chris, cut from the same mold as his father, and Danny, the more sensitive of the two who was initially thought to have committed suicide. Questionable circumstances surrounded the death. Sayre hated her father and years earlier had left the small town vowing never to return or to speak with him again. Following the service, she met Beck Merchant, the Hoyle family attorney. They butted heads immediately but strong sexual sparks flew between the two making it difficult for them to stay apart for long.The Novel is a quick read, interesting in spots and boring and drawn out in others. As always, Brown surprises the reader toward the end, White Hot is no exception. There are many twists and turns in the final pages.

As Realtor Regan McHenry takes on the task of creatively marketing the murder house where a double murder took place almost 2 decades ago, her initial cozy look and feel of the house would evaporate by a series of events and calamities.As young eccentric Stevie purchases the house his relatives become evident most notably his murder victim father Roger Commons.  Just who was the murderer years ago and could this be linked to the murder victim found buried near the property?  This Bonny Doon home would serve a severe lesson also to any innocent victim willing to barge in uninvited.  Realtor Regan McHenry will find herself moved in a detective type role where relationship dynamics will be uncovered and each layer will consistently confuse even the best of murder mystery solvers.  Just when the evidence seems convincing will Jarvis throw a twist and more facts your way to keep you consistently off balance.The murder mystery is &#34;all in the family&#34; inclusive and will get you wondering:--Was it the demons that perpetrated vengeful killings...or was it troubled minds that took their free will choice to commit these horrible murders?  You will discover Stevie's &#34;Revenge Quest&#34; war game did have glitches in the system that haven't been worked out...and now never will be.  Whether it be repeated ghosts or neighbors strong imaginations-you will be left to decide when all is said or done.Put on your murder mystery hat and be ready to get a full body workout.  It will , like it did Regan, perhaps keep you up late at night.  This clever Author has used her 25 year tenure as a Realtor in the Santa Cruz area to shape her scenarios with another fine book to her credit.

(No such work as 'geek' in Hebrew.)They spend a lot of time analysing the impact of doing compulsory national military service before attending university (seen as a very good thing) and of having a very flat social structure (everyone has a nickname and is known by it from 'Bibi' the Prime Minister down).

The other strong point in it's favor is the author's stories of children's reactions to dying and death. You can let these stories be a guide to what is normal or what may be cause for concern.The part about support groups was wasted on me, it wasn't what I was looking for in this book. The author's take on religion I had to disregard also, I think that if the child is in a religious home it can be a huge comfort to them.

6938,"I would be remiss if I didn't include additional information about this and the previous series titled McBride novels.  Each of these books in some way deals with a social issue.The McBride series is composed of five stories with Mike McBride as the lead character.  He's a detective in the police force of Carson City, New Mexico and in love with Juliette whom he finally marries in book five.  Each of these books deals with cocaine, cartels, smuggling and illegal immigration.  Dorothy May Mercer is very passionate about these social issues.  She exposes the abuse of illegal immigrants, which may include murders and deaths in the desert; gun smuggling; and trafficking of women over the border. Through clever plots that are so close to reality I felt I was reading a documentary.Here I quote Dorothy: ""In #5 of the McBride Series, Mike is appointed senator. In the end he addresses the Senate in a rip-roaring speech that is so emotional that it transforms the Senate into passing humane Comprehensive Immigration reform.The reform bill is hugely successful and brings about a new era of prosperity for the US, beyond the wildest expectations. It provides multiple avenues to take care of those already in the US, and sets up a legal system for migrant workers, to cross the border to waiting jobs. I am proud of my ideas for a comprehensive solution to immigration issues, and would dearly love to see them considered in the Congress. The ideas are mine, and are different in some ways from current proposals floating around.""In the Washington McBride series, Mike and Juliette play a role in all three novels.  He is now a freshman senator.  In book 1 titled The FairFax Fix Mike breaks up a gang in Fairfax which coerces high school young women into prostitution.  This story was sparked by an actual Fairfax, Virginia criminal gang.In book 2 Juliette is more involved when she starts work as an investigative reporter.  Here is a quote from Dorothy May Mercer:""This novel was inspired by an article about the rescue of women working as domestic slaves in a McLean residence of the Saudi embassy. Also, inspired by the news about the 11 year old girl who needed a lung transplant, if you remember the story. I included that angle to expose the trafficking in human organs. In this book Juliette's old college room-mate, Fran, disappears.""And now the review.About the Story: This is Fran's story. After she vanished without a trace, off the streets of Washington, D.C., her friend, Juliette McBride, suffered agonies of grief and remorse. Juliette could not erase the feeling that Fran was still alive, somewhere in the world, yearning to return home. In her twin positions as investigative reporter for WXN-TV and columnist for the Washington Times, Juliette had access to resources not available to the average person. Disregarding danger, Juliette continued to snoop into organized crime, hoping to find a clue to the whereabouts of Fran. Then, one day, it happened...My Thoughts:  I almost put the book down not far into the story.  I was afraid it would be one of those stories that scare the hell out of you.  I forced myself beyond that point and realized that the author had done a lot of research and thought to provide the reader a very plausible story and one with a powerful message.  This story spoke about the issues of human trafficking and issues related to surrogacy.It was quick paced, suspenseful, informative, and definitely a good read. This is the third book of a series so there is some back story that I don't have which would no doubt give me a better grasp of who Fran was in her life before her kidnapping, but it is a book that stands alone.Along with a very good suspenseful read, the story does a marvelous job in exposing the plight of women who are outright kidnapped off the street or coerced into being a gestational carrier, a form of human trafficking and slavery.  Dorothy's stories are based on documentaries, articles and excellent research, written with such realism that I was able to grasp the horror of their plight and the total hopelessness that women find themselves in. Some women are held for years and years with the promise of retiring with plenty of money and if housed in the U.S. American citizenship.  It is hard to understand how a woman could be duped with such promises, but when you understand their helpless and poverty-stricken lives in some cases, you can understand that they are reaching for the possibility of hope--a hope to survive with a chance in life.  The story did a good job in this area and for that reason I had to contact the author to know more about her intentions behind the story.I know the work of dogs in calamities that strike such as earthquakes, mud slides, or hurricane/tornado.  They have an extremely keen sense of smell and also a benefit in tracking a person.  Lady, the dog hero of the story, has a special place in my heart.  I loved how Dorothy wove her into the story.If you enjoy fiction with suspense, intrigue which deals with very real issues of today, then you'll love how Dorothy writes.  I learned so much.  And as I found out, that was her intent.  Thank you Dorothy for a terrific series.",5.0

Except the woman has passed away unexpectedly, leaving Eliza unsure what to do next. She's approached by the town mute, John, who mistakes her for his mail-order bride.

6949,"A history of the conquering of Central and South America by Cortes, the Pisaros and Oryanis as told from original sources.As dry as that sounds, its not  bad at all.  My last familiarity with South American history ended in about the 6th grade, so this was a long needed refresher.  This is a scholarly tale with an attempt at being told in a story book fashion.  There appear to be a number of books out there  covering both Cortes and the Pisaros, and I doubt this is unique.  Wood does attempt to relate it in a more story book fashion to relieve it  from being history class dry.  He partially succeeds but does not have quite the style of, say, Mark Kurlansky, who could make the contents of  a tube of toothpaste sound interesting.  Wood groups facts, chronology, and reasonable supposition to get at the real story, which I appreciate.  The story you get in the 6th grade is so sanitized to some group's personal point of view that the real story gets lost or twisted.  From Woods  account you can get a pretty good idea (based on human nature) of what went on.  Wood also recounts observations from his trip of tracing the  steps of conquistadors along the paths they took, but this is barely memorable.  I will say that Woods had me flicking through Google maps and Wikipedia trying to trace routes, find locations and distances, the range of empires and topological features.  This is always a good  sign for me.Bottom Line:  If you like history or historical novels and haven't had an update since  6th grade South American history, then thisis probably a good place to start.  It will refashion your understanding of the conquest by the Spanish conquistadors.",4.0

6955,"To me this book resonated between the feel of &#34;Tears for Tess&#34; and played in my head kind of like the movie &#34;Sucker Punch&#34; (in terms of the girls and being forced by an impeccably neat man).From the get-go I was hooked because action began at the very beginning and didn't stop until the ending scene- what a ride! Addy's strength and life made her a unique heroine and I have to say she is an inspiration considering all of the struggles she endured. Her relationship with her fellow &#34;girls&#34; and horrible Nate, cruel Zane and quiet Jackson were well written and well defined.I appreciated the author's opening note about the prevalence and severity of human trafficking and was grateful that the book did not go into explicit detail in every scene. There was a great balance between detail and implication because the book didn't need the gore and emotional trauma to be riveting- it was perfect on its own.The only negative thing I can say about the book is how easily it ended and how fast it was wrapped up. I loved the ending but thought it lost some of the realistic feel the rest of the book held. I wonder if novellas in the POV of the other girls, or Zane are in the works. I would have also liked to hear about how the family was struggling or the search efforts, but it wouldn't have added to the plot except in length so I can see why it wasn't included.Overall, a great book, but not for the faint of heart. It's gritty and real and messed up which is probably why I liked it.",5.0

Also, the description is good in the sense that adjectives are used appropriately.The reader is jettisoned into the kids' world when they play with the toys. The excitement of the play-time is contrasted with the disappointment of having to clean up the toys.The hero, Ron, lies to his mother and his mother gets angry with him for not picking up the toys. Later, when the toys come back to life, Ron learns the consequences of his actions.It is a great and subtle message for kids, and a great bedtime story. Highly recommended.",5.0
6961,"This book with three really great romantic novels was a joy to read. It made you feel good and happy at the end. The first story was about Deuce finding that his true love,Kendra, who was someone that loved him unconditionally all his life and in doing so made his life complete. The only probable was he did not  realize it until he almost lost her. Then he had to do everything possible to convince her that he truly loved her. A very sweet story about a forced to retire ball player who came back to run his family's bar only to find it being made into an internet coffee shop by the girl he could not stop thinking about for the last five years. Together they rebuild the bar and their dreams together grow. The second novel is about a heinous woman doctor who is afraid of life  and just wants to be left alone to work with no attachments. Little does she know that friends find her and force her to Jill Shalvis style of writing is so witty, romantic and fun to read. Nicole, the doctor starts to finally open up to Ty, an architect that her friend hired to fix up their apartments. Even though they both do not want to they find themselves hopelessly attracted to each other and eventually fall in love. A very sweet romantic story. The third novel is about best friends that then fall in love. Connors best friend Emma was the person he shared everything with and never thought of her as a sexy woman. One night she dresses script to make him think of her as not just one of the guys. It makes him aware of her as a beautiful woman and not just a pal. What should he do if he does not want to lose his best friend is the question. It is such a great set of stories and a great read. This collection of novels is so much fun to read and I highly recommend  This romantic hot book.",5.0

There are a few pages or so here dedicated to the topic of finding and using ghostwriters to create your books. Keeping in mind that most of Evans work is about creating passive income streams, it follows that he would be adept in the area of using ghostwriters.

6970,"*I received an ARC from the author for review*I've read all of the books in the Moments series, and I must say, that this book was the most heart-wrenching. &#34;This Time&#34; follows the story of Jamie and Tor, whom we saw a cameo of from book 2, &#34;Right Now&#34;. But back in book 2, Jamie had this on again/of again relationship with Angel, a violent drug addict. Tor meets Jamie at one of his concerts, and they end up having a one-night stand, which leads to some serious consequences that carry the rest of the story. These consequences eventually bring Jamie and Tor together, and Jamie's eyes are open to the truth about Angel, and how much of a poison he's been to her all this time. She also realizes just how much she's been taking Tor's kindness for granted and it forces her to rethink her whole life.What I love about this story (and all of the books in this series) is the realism of the situations the characters are put in. A huge issue in this book was the subject of domestic violence, and how it's hard for a woman to leave their boyfriend whom they think they&#8217;re in love with, and not realize how much it's hurting them. I've known people like this in real life, and it's heart-breaking to watch this, which is why I connected so much with Tor and his frustrations of trying to get Jamie to forget about Angel because of the way he mistreated her all the time.Jamie in book 2, came off as a ditz, but in book 3, we see her in a new light and understand her situation a bit more. She is very caring and trusting of others, sometimes a little too much. So I think the relationship between her and Tor worked well. She also needed a friend like Zoe to keep her focused on the straight path.I have a weakness for Vikings and all things Norse mythology, and so I clung to Tor immediately. I loved his character. He's very protective of Jamie, and yet, very loving and caring. He's definitely the perfect guy. &#8220;This Time&#8221; is told in alternating points of view, and I really enjoyed reading Tor&#8217;s POV. He&#8217;s so honorable, loyal, and drop-dead sexy, what more could a girl want?This story has very few steamy scenes, and that&#8217;s fine because it worked given the things that happened in this story. But those few scenes are pretty hot, regardless.  The story revolved around the growing relationship between Tor and Jamie, and how life unknowingly brings the two of them together whether they are ready or not.The author did a great job executing this story, and if it&#8217;s intended to be the last book of this series, it was closed very well with a sweet HEA and epilogue.",5.0

6982,"I really enjoyed Karen Foxlee&#8217;s young adult book, The Midnight Dress, so when I heard she was writing a middle grade novel that was a fairy tale retelling I was so excited to read it.  I got a copy of this book to review through the Amazon Vine program.  It ended up being a very good retelling of the Snow Queen, the writing is beautiful and very atmospheric.Ophelia Jane Worthington-Whittard and her sister, Alice, are still grieving the death of their mother when their father decides to take a job prepping a museum for a sword exhibition in a strange city where it always snows.  The museum is dark and has some fabulous nooks and crannies to explore.  While Alice is drawn in by the owner of the museum, a very elegant yet strange women&#8230;.Ophelia is drawn to explore the dark corridors of the museum.One day while peeking in an eye hole, she finds an eye peeking back at her.  This is how she meets The Marvelous Boy, who has been trapped by the Snow Queen in this room for 75 years.  He convinces Ophelia to go on a number of adventures throughout the museum all in an effort to find a magical sword and to save the world from the clutches of the Snow Queen.I absolutely adored this book.  The writing is beautiful and magical, and the story has such a great dark fairy tale type of atmosphere.  It was a very well done retelling of the Snow Queen.The whole book takes place in an old museum.  I love books like this.  The old museum is so magical and the enchanting things Ophelia finds within the museum are bewitching and so creative.  I love books where people explore something that at first seems mundan, but then ends up containing many marvelous wonders.The story is done in a wonderful way.  Some parts of the book are told from Ophelia&#8217;s perspective during the current day.  There are also other parts of the book where the Marvelous Boy tells Opehlia the magical stories that make up his past.  Both perspectives are very engaging and I found myself looking forward to them equally.At first Ophelia is reluctant to help, she doesn't believe in magic.  Ophelia is strictly a science type of girl, her mother was the fanciful one and the death of her mother has only solidified Ophelia&#8217;s commitment to facts and science.  But as the Boy tells his tale, Ophelia is drawn in and can't help but be curious.  She ends up doing small quests for the Marvelous Boy in order to hear the next portions of his story and it is in this way Ophelia confronts her fears and accomplishes some truly marvelous things on her own.The book wraps up nicely and has some nice discussion around the importance of friends and family.  The writing is beautiful and was wonderful to read.  My only complaint is that the story is fairly predictable.  I knew right away who the Snow Queen was and how she was tied in with the sword exhibition at the museum.Overall I loved this book, the story is engaging and beautifully written.  The pictures throughout are magical.  It was just an absolutely wonderful fairy tale retelling.  Recommended for readers of all ages, especially for those who love wonderful fairy tale retellings.  I look forward to what Foxlee writes next.",5.0
6983,"This is one of the first in a series of books showing that kids can grow up to be whatever they want to be.Carlee isn't too excited about her first day of school because her mom is the teacher for the other 1st grade section.  Carlee is afraid the kids aren't going to like her because her mom is a teacher. In the story we journey through Carlee's first day and experience her nervousness and excitement as she travels through her classes.  One thing Carlee knows for sure, is that she doesn't want to be a teacher like her mom. She was sure all the kids were laughing at her mom and her and she was so embarrassed.  As Carlee imagines being anything BUT a teacher, we are introduced to real life people in those professions like Christopher Columbus, Neil Armstrong, and Marie Curie.  By the end of the day, Carlee is surprised to learn that the kids love her mom as their teacher.  Carlee realizes having a mom for a teacher isn't so bad and maybe being a teacher is just what she wants to be.I love how there is a story mixed in with the non-fiction parts of the book.  It is kind of a fiction/non-fiction book. We learn factual information about real people as Carlee travels through her day. Carlee's story is realistic enough for kids to identify with her fears, hesitations and excitement on her first day.  As someone who works in our children's school, I know the embarrassment and excitement that our children feel when I am in the building.Our 9-year old read this book and enjoyed it.  She liked reading the quotes and information about real people.  She liked Carlee's character and all the jobs she considered being.  Our daughter also wants to be a teacher (as of today) and this book reinforced that for her.",5.0

6995,"I have recently read Tim Winton's 'Eyrie', and I must admit that I was disappointed with this novel. I have read almost all Tim Winton's books, and I have enjoyed all the previous novels very much. These previous novels all dealt with the culture of the coast, and the ocean and the various types of characters who enjoy the unique experience of living along this beautiful and dramatic and sometimes dangerous region of  Western Australia. However I was disappointed with this novel. It has been set in a seedy block of flats in a not so salubrious part of suburban Freemantle, and involves the relationship between a rather dull and poorly motivated public servant and a young single mother and her young son, who live in adjacent flats and are both (mother and neighbour) quite dysfunctional.

6996,"Eden Winters is looking at the other end of romance&#8212;what happens in a long relationship when trouble&#8217;s brewing? This short gives us a look at breaking, healing, and rekindling of what had been so good for so long.Ian is too stinking proud to chase after Travis when he left, even to ask why. The wound in their twenty-plus year relationship has been festering, with neither willing to cut loose, but neither willing to reach out. A milestone anniversary and a persistent son get them back in the same room long enough to see what went wrong and get a glimmer of how to fix it.Ian is our PoV character, and the inside of his head isn&#8217;t very comfortable. He feels wronged and slighted, and justified in thinking that at long last he&#8217;ll sever the tie Travis frayed by leaving. He misses Travis bitterly, but pride is a deadly sin. The author proceeds to deliver a reality check of monumental proportions, starting with finding out how Ian cut Travis out of their friend&#8217;s lives, and adding smack after smack until Ian is forced to confront the fact that he&#8217;s actually been a douchecanoe.Travis has his own demons&#8212;clinical depression played with his judgment, leaving him unable to speak up for himself. When he does speak up, Ian&#8217;s horrified by what he has to say.It&#8217;s a huge turnaround for Ian to acknowledge his shortcomings, and it&#8217;s also a major struggle for Travis to emerge from his depression and decide how he wants to truly live. This is Eden Winters writing: her characters end up happy but they have to work for it. Hard. Really, really hard.Leaving aside the issue of how they went so long before they actually got to the most basic question, (my one quibble), this is a lovely story of redemption and love restored.",5.0

However the book suffers from the leads spending most of their time dating other people, and then pushing and pulling with each other for the last third of the book. Also Lauren's known Jessie for 11 years, but doesn't seem to know her at all and finds out most of her new info about Jessie from other people and not from talking to Jessie, so it was hard to see why Jessie liked Lauren so much.

7007,"Literary fiction can be fun. Cristopher Jansma shows how its done in The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards. This debut novel, now available in paperback, follows the worldwide travels of the ultimate unreliable narrator. It&#8217;s like ten books in one &#8211; a Southern coming of age story, an academic farce, a New York excursion and an expat&#8217;s tall tale &#8211; propelled forward by neatly contained chapters (which are like stories within stories). The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards is compulsively readable, filled with oddball characters, strange situations and sudden turns of fate, all told by a sort of Nick Carroway, looking on enviously at the Gatsbys all around him.My only criticism: The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards switches scenes too quickly. Plot threads are picked up and dropped. Sometimes, you want to know more about that couple in Dubai. You want more &#8211; a good sign in a novel.Ultimately, The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards is a book about stories, the ones that are true, and the ones we tell ourselves. &#8220;Tell all the truth, but tell it slant,&#8221; Emily Dickinson says, a mantra that runs throughout this novel. With their ability to tell it slant, novels contain truths that you won&#8217;t find in the newspaper.The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards demonstrates the power of literary fiction to provide enlightenment through entertainment. Great storytelling is a kind of trick, an ancient one that we&#8217;re programmed to enjoy. Like listening to some stranger&#8217;s shaggy dog tale, we know that what we&#8217;re hearing is not technically true. But we have to know how it ends. Great literary fiction is like that, wrapping us up in an engaging story that tells it slant.",5.0

It was odd, how in real mythology he never really got... together (hehe) with anyone. Now it's explained through his... friendship (hehe) with Medusa. Overall, I loved this twist on Greek mythology! I liked how the author described (most) of the Greek Gods. She gave a lot them happy endings that real mythology doesn't. Definitely a worthwhile read!",5.0

7014,"The Goldfinch won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and it's hard to understand why.  The writing is beautiful, but the story and characters leave a lot to be desired.  The protagonist is a boy who survives a domestic terrorist attack (losing his mother in the process) who suffers long-term trauma because of it.  If Ms. Tartt had focused on this aspect of the character, perhaps she would have had something.  As it is, the plot meanders from New York to Las Vegas to Amsterdam with no logical rhyme or reason. More than a quarter of the novel follows the protagonist as he indulges in booze and drugs, all the while pining away for a woman who he has idealized beyond all logic.The last hundred pages lack credulity, and the ending is trite and completely unbelievable.  I put the novel down grateful that I had finally finished it.  That isn't an emotion the author hopes for in a reader, but it is the one most strongly engendered.",2.0

7017,"Paul Stanley's book comes across as a brutally honest, almost self depreciating at times, portrayal of his life. Written in a matter-of-fact manner without any guilt or judgment, it gives a realistic view into the world of he private lives of the members of KISS. To see the real man behind the persona was shocking, to see that his trials and tribulations were no different from anyone else. Paul certainly has had his share of demons to battle and it is refreshing to see him fight them without the help of drugs or alcohol.It is also refreshing to see that he treated and still does, KISS, as a business and something he takes very serious. A conclusion one could make is, Paul was the glue that was holding the box together all those years. While Gene and Paul have been friends for years, it is interesting that Paul's business sense allowed him to set that aspect of the relationship aside. Like other bands, they made and lost a fortune to being inexperienced, Paul and Gene did get it figured out and went on to make a mint. However, I am sure the two other guys would have a different take on it.Another aspect to the book that I found meaningful is the way that Paul charts his life on the path to self-discovery, in how at this stage in his life, he has found that &#34;it&#34; and knows what it means to him. There are some rather moving lines in the book where he expresses the wisdom he has acquired through it all. While Paul is a showman, behind the makeup, there is a decent normal guy, someone with whom you would like to call a friend.An excellent book, an excellent look into the inner-workings of a major band, for any fan of rock, this is a must-read, and one that I certainly recommend.",5.0

She is my kind of heroine, not afraid to step into a situation even when being warned away by those who want to protect her and threatened by those who want her to keep her pretty nose out of their business.The author has painted a picture of a time when Pasadena was being &#34;invaded&#34; by some elements, transplanted from the south, who wanted to disrupt the reasonable racial atmosphere in the city and at the same time profit through some nefarious land deals.It's a clear picture that the &#34;good old days&#34; were not always so good for everyone.Altogether and enjoyable read for those who enjoy mysteries set in the 1920s, in California and in specific, in Pasadena.",5.0
7019,"This was my very first read by author Ben Burgess Jr., and I must truly say, I was eager to get started, because I'd heard lots of good things in passing about the author and this book.Wounded very quickly draws your attention, and you find yourself immediately sympathizing with Samantha Miller, the main character in the book.  Sam, as her friends call her, has a very horrible childhood, and goes through all kinds of hell. You quickly want to fight for her, protect her, and shelter her.  She grows up hardened and bitter, not caring too much about anyone other than her two best friends. She's hard pressed to insure that her surroundings, childhood, and circumstances turn into a stepping-stone of opportunity for her.Throughout this book, I found myself going through several cycles of emotions; I cried, I cussed, I cheered, and I learned a little something.  Without giving away the book or the ending, I will say that it reminded me that you can't just go through life, you have to grow through it.  This book was very well written, the characters are well developed, and you can identify with them, and it has a twist towards the end that you don't see coming.  I was truly in tears towards the end, and when I closed the book.I am now a fan of Ben Burgess' work, and eagerly look forward to reading his other books.  I would definitely recommend this book to others who are looking for a great read!",5.0

7023,"This is a very hard review for me to write because I really adore Jamie McGuire's books.  I loved the other books in the series, and have been looking forward to reading more about The Maddox Brothers.  Because it is The Maddox Brothers Series, one would assume that we would get the book from Trent's POV, or alternating POVs, but we don't; the entire book is from Cami's.  To say that I was disappointed because of this is an understatement.  Because it is from Cami's POV, I feel that we don't really get to know who Trent is, which is what I was looking forward to.*****Spoilers Ahead*****I figured out pretty early on who TJ was, so there wasn't a lot of mystery/suspense there.  I was looking forward to how it would play out once Trent discovered who TJ was, but because we aren't hearing the story from Trent, and Cami was unconscious when he found out, the whole &#34;reveal&#34; is basically brushed over in one sentence.  To me, this was the biggest letdown of the book.  So much emphasis had been placed on Cami trying to keep TJ's identity a secret from Trent, and being upset at how he would react when he found out, I just expected there to be a big climatic scene, so I was really disappointed when we didn't get that.I was also disappointed with how the book ended.  It would have been so nice to have an epilogue that gave us a glimpse into Cami and Trent's relationship a few months in advance now that everything is out in the open, and TJ has backed off from contacting Cami, but we don't get that.  The book just ended.All that being said, the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2 is because of Trent.  Even though we don't have his POV, I LOVED him.  He is just so sweet.  The scenes with him and Olive were some of my favorite parts of the book.  I loved that he was so caring, protective, understanding, and had a great sense of humor.  I honestly feel that if the book had been written from his POV, it would have been a solid 5 star for me.",3.0
7024,"THIS. BOOK. WILL. KILL. YOU. Fans of the Angelfire series, be warned. This book will rock you to the core, but it is oh so good. I loved every little letter that made up every word in every sentence within the pages of this book. I do not think Courtney Allison Moulton could have wrapped this series up any better. From beginning to end I was hooked. This book turned me into an emotional wreck, but those are the books that always end up being my favorites.Ellie continues to be one of my favorite heroines. She is kickass and strong and nothing ever keeps her down for long. She has to overcome so many different obstacles and she does each and every time. No matter what is thrown at her, I never doubt her ability to persevere. Ellie is a character that is faced with incredibly tough choices, but she always thinks about the greater good and always strives to make the right choice. Some of the choices she makes are not the best for her, but she does it anyway.This book has a lot more Cadan, and I was surprisingly okay with that, which I did not think I would be. His character is very different from when we first met him and I truly enjoyed watching his character change. His character truly fascinates me and I loved the journey his character took. Cadan shows that what you are does not define you, and you can choose to better yourself.Now you are probably thinking; &#8220;Teresa, aren&#8217;t you a crazy Will fan? Why did this review not start off with all sorts of Will rambling?&#8221; Well about that&#8230; Will is left in a very precarious position at the end of Wings of the Wicked and well I simply refuse to let anyone know what happens to him one way or another. You can suffer like I did while reading. I spent a lot of time dying to know what was going to happen to Will one way or the other. I will say this, what you do see of Will is swoony.As I said before, Shadows in the Silence is a great story and it will make your heart hurt. You will truly feel for the characters and become heavily invested in their story. The book will constantly break your heart and it seems as if the poor characters simply cannot catch a break. It seems as if they go from one tragedy to the next. The book will tear you down, only to lift you back up again. I am pretty sure the pages of the book are stained with my tears. I cried so much; I don&#8217;t mean I shed a tear, I mean full on hysterical crying until I couldn&#8217;t see any more tears. I had worries because I read this book right after Finale (sometimes after I read a favorite, the next book pales in comparison), but my worry was misplaced. I loved Shadows in the Silence just as much as I thought I would. I loved taking the journey with these characters and seeing Ellie&#8217;s story come to a conclusion.My absolute favorite thing about this book is that CAM did not take the easy way out. Sacrifices are made and not everyone comes out of this story happy on the other side. She shows that a war like this is not easy and simple; sometimes there are drastic consequences. CAM shows that sometimes sacrifice is necessary for the greater good and that if the person is strong enough, that sacrifice could benefit numerous others. I know this sounds preachy, but this book really does show that, simply by not giving every character a happily ever after. I hate to compare books to Harry Potter, but I am going to with this one, at least in terms of this one aspect. Both authors recognized that when a war like this occurs, some characters will be lost along the way and that things are not always easy. The loss of these characters makes you appreciate the outcome all the more and it makes the situation believable (as much as a paranormal story is ever believable.)To sum it all up, I seriously loved this book and I cannot wait to go back and live it all over again. I am torn because I love the way the series turned out, but now I am devastated that I do not have another book to look forward to. Thankfully we have Madeline and Bastian&#8217;s story to look forward to. CAM did a fabulous job wrapping up this series and I look forward to anything she has in store for us in the future. One last thing, I am totally on Team Waffles!",5.0

Great urban fantasy, in which for a change the demons are the good guys (kind of anyway).The characters (even those on the side lines) are easily lovable. The chemistry between them is exciting. Since English is not my mother tongue I understood and welcomed the use of Italian curses and swear words, which for me underlined Kali's authenticity.Lots of twists and turns, and the mystery just keeps going.

7033,"Just recently I took a trip to the local zoo. Many of the animals were rather lazy, restful and calm. They were well fed, well-groomed, and content. For the most part, they weren&#8217;t ferocious nor wild. The only animals that were of any character and relentlessness were the monkeys. But the tigers, now the tigers&#8230;they could&#8217;ve been very ferocious and forceful, but they were not. They barely moved. It seemed like just another exhibit.Does church feel like that sometimes? Does your walk feel similar most days? Just another day. Just another worship service. Just another habit, routine, ritual. I wonder if we have given ourselves to boredom because we feel as if we can tame God and control Him. It seems as if we are our own God and the God of the bible, is our pet. How contrary to the Word of God are our lives when we live as if God is on our leash.Many Christian books today are written for the purpose of encouragement, comfort, and rest in God&#8230;which is needed and is true. But have we taken too many doses of that aspect of God and become spiritually lethargic? Perhaps so.This book will not make you feel good and it will not comfort you. But it will challenge you. It will sober you to the truth of the power, capability and awesomeness of God. In doing so, you may awakened from slumber and return to the fact that God doesn&#8217;t need you, your approval or your permission.If this sounds like a challenge&#8230;then accept it and read this new book. And like a tiger who is attentive to his territory in which causes the hair on his neck and back to rise&#8230;perhaps yours will rise as well as you read these pages.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

7034,"WOW What a series, Could Not Put It Down From the First Book To This One! I finished From Darkness Won minutes ago and the transition back to the real world is still not complete; part of me is still in the land of Er'Rets with my friends. But are we mourning or celebrating? This book had so many wonderful scenes... I got emotional more than once. In fact, I don't remember the last time I was more emotionally attached to the characters of a novel. It's a bit scary, to be honest. What a satisfying conclusion. This was the best of the trilogy, and that is no small feat. The Blood of Kings Trilogy, and especially From Darkness Won, has earned a permanent and prominent spot on my book shelf. Jill Williamson is one of the best authors I've ever read. With From Darkness Won, she crafted a thrilling, pleasurable adventure sure to ensnare you from the first page to the last. It certainly snared me. It enriched my life and my imagination. First it made my day, then had me happily reading WAY into the night. You know you've got a good book when you're not mad at the author for making you stay up!The vivid characters, scenes, places, and of course, the humor, will haunt your memory long after you've put this book down. I loved From Darkness Won! If possible, it's the best of the Blood of Kings Series, although each book has its own flair. But one thing's sure: you'll never forget this enchanting climax of the quest to vanquish Darkness and win back the Kingship of Er'Rets.Thank you, Jill, for writing From Darkness Won.

I have loved their books so far but this one sucked me in from the first paragraph. I will be singing praises for Beautiful Player (and the rest of the series) for a VERY LONG time!!Brief Synopsis:Hanna is a brilliant overachiever who lives a pretty regimented life in order to achieve her next career goal; no matter the cost of her social life. When her brother challenges her to quit being so self-isolating, he puts her in touch with his best friend, Will, in hopes that he can bring her out of her shell and perhaps show her the ropes on some sort of social balance. What nobody expected was the immediate chemistry between the two.Will is a bit of a player. But he's also stuck in a routine that clearly defines his daily life. And he has no plans to change that; until a whirlwind of bottled up surprises comes storming into his life. He agrees to helping bring his best friends little sister out of her draining rut and show her around, as friends. But Hanna is not at all the young girl he barely remembers. He may have just met his unexpected match.My Review:Where to begin?! I have been waiting what feels like months for a story to consume me from start to finish. I do have to say that this is a bit of an understatement. This book swallowed me whole and I am still enjoying the after effects several days later. Reading from a dual POV, I fell in love with the backstory of these characters, the undeniable attraction and the downright naughty banter. And of course, their intense sexual chemistry is so incredibly steamy.""I'm thinking about how naive and sweet you are. I'm wondering what I've agreed to do here, when I said I would help you figure out the whole dating world. I'm worried I'm going to make you into the most vulnerable bombshell in the history of the planet.""Hanna is so full of surprises, I found myself with tears streaming down my face several times from laughing so hard.Will: ""Do you even know what a triathlon is?""  Hanna: ""Of course I do. It's the swim, run, shoot a bear thing.""Hanna is so incredibly down to earth, just stuck in a rut created by her ingrained drive to stay focused and achieve her next goal. She's had a thing for Will since her childhood, but knowing about his lifestyle of dating beautiful women...often, she enlists his help in figuring out the opposite sex. Her plan is to get in, learn from the master and then escape unharmed. Her plan goes to s*** the moment she sees him for the first time in years.""Did I want him to just be my brother's friend, helping me find more balance? Or did I want to get a grown-up look at the object of my filthiest fantasies?""Will is so sweet, so incredibly loveable and above all, naughty as sin.""Hanna was this uninhibited, self-possessed woman in front of me who I was pretty sure was going to effectively wreck my world.""Hanna and Will are going down as two of my favorite characters I've ever read about. They are both absently searching for something more in their lives, not knowing that what either of them really need is each other. I loved absolutely everything about this book. I'm a sucker for adorable nicknames and I think this one takes the cake for me: Plum. (Petal from Beautiful Stranger - also in this series - is a very super close second place). These authors nailed this book. I didn't feel like I was reading a book thrown together for the sake of extending a series that should have been done several books ago. I truly felt the depth of these characters and their blind need for each other.High-fives to these two authors who have created an amazingly captivating series with characters that are so relatable and funny.

7052,"]In every author's life there one time when their heart opens and they pour their inner soul into their finest work. Sad Songs is Velda Brotherton's gift to those of us who aren't there yet. This is how it's done. With a skill in defining male characters, the like of which hasn't been seen since Steinbeck, Brotherton allows us into the shattered souls of three men who at first meeting are simply motorcycle bums roaming the country, holing up in campgrounds, just living thru the pain. The scene is an Arkansas State Park. Steven and Lefty are 'Nam buddies; Shadow is a black rebel from the mean streets of Detroit. But this isn't about the men. It's about Mary Elizabeth, who arrives alone, taking time-out from a dreary, abusive marriage to a religious cult leader. After years of endurance, she has reached that point when she wonders if her life could be better. This is a story of redemption, and four lost souls who have the courage to try to remake themselves into something with meaning. There lies the story, told by a master whose skill has been honed by years of experience. Don't read the synopsis. Be surprised at the twists and turns of the plot. Although men will relate to this book, it is about everywoman who has reached the age of forty. An incredible achievement. You'll love it.[[ASIN:1603819592 Maddie's Choice]",5.0

7072,"From what i could gather, this is not the first book in the series. That is both unfortunate and fortunate. Unfortunate because i may have missed some things, but it is fortunate because I read this one. One of the aspects of this tale that caught was the taunt three way between Bo, Brooklyn, and Ruth. The scenario could have easily been from a reality television show but well written. Add in the fact that Brooklyn has an ailment, and you've got heavy conflict.Ironically, there is  biblical reference here but not along the same happy ending. The characters' names, Bo and Ruth, come directly from religious lore. Bo being short for Boaz, while Ruth is the actual namesake. It makes me wonder was this intentional by author. Hmmm. for me, it was a bit humorous.Don't judge me but i really got into Ruth. She reminded me of Alexis Colby from the &#34;Dynasty&#34; tv show. She was a classic villain. And truthfully, she pulled me into the story. Now i have to go back and read the first one. Bravo!!!",5.0

What I discovered was a story about some characters that none had any redeeming qualities and the story ended and that's it. I read the book quite quickly because on many pages there was only a paragraph or two and on some pages there was only a sentence. This was probably considered some sort of a writing style, but I found it kind of a cop out, like she was just trying to add pages to the book. For a debut novel I would hope Ms. Morris puts this book aside and tries a new approach.",3.0

The Waiting is especially effective at inducing dread because it is rooted in a common, if  not universal, fear:  the illness of a loved one, and the utter helplessness we feel when a cherished life hangs in the balance.  Remove the paranormal aspects of the story, and you still have a gripping tale.  But Shea's personal twist on the ghost story is as fresh as it is frightening,  and Shea himself, in only the past two years, has provided the genre with a desperately needed transfusion of new blood.  Now the waiting begins anew for The Montauk Monster.",4.0
7082,"My ReviewSo many of you know&#8230; I&#8217;ve been a fan of this series since I read Slave two years ago!!! Since then, I&#8217;ve reread this series many times and have shared it with many of my friends. If you have not read this series, go and grab it now! It is worth it!! Books 1-3 were all 5 stars for me!And then&#8230;&#8230; book 4 was released yesterday! I quit blogging and went straight to reading! I was up until 4:15am reading this book!The book starts where the last one left off, Anna has just left Stephan in an attempt to decrease the likelihood of him getting into trouble with the Feds since they just became aware that he bought Anna! Oh s***! That was my first thought when I read the end of book 3!This book follows the emotional legal battle that the two of them face now that the world is aware that she has been a human traffic victim. Stephan is a high profile public figure which only adds to the media&#8217;s desire to dig up dirt.How will Anna handle not being with her Dom? How will she be able to cope without the one person who has been able to help her find peace after being isolated by her fears? Can she move on without Stephan?SLIGHT SPOILERS!!OMG!!! My heart just kept breaking over and over for this couple! For Anna to spend 2 months with minimal eating and socializing after leaving Stephan! UGH!!! That is not what I wanted for them! I wanted the feds to leave them alone and realize right away that Stephan was perfect&#8230;&#8230;but of course&#8230; that didn&#8217;t happen.I was not surprised by Cal&#8217;s continued hatred of Stephan but I was surprised by how supportive Jade was of the situation. Moving in and taking care of Anna&#8230;&#8230;. Without any jealousy! I give Sherri two thumbs up for that. I&#8217;m tired of reading about how other women try to bring the other woman down. And then when Stephan&#8217;s first submissive shows up and then stays with Stephan&#8230;.. I loved how she was supportive of their relationship and was not trying to get Stephan back.I&#8217;m glad that Anna was pushed into therapy. I, however, was not impressed with the way the therapist handled Stephan. Actually&#8230;&#8230; I wanted to reach through my iPad and slap her!!! Extremely unethical for her to do that, knowing how Anna feels about him. But she did eventually see Stephan for the loving, caring and protective man that he is. She even commented on not understanding them and how in tuned they are with each other. I felt like Stephan did more therapeutically for her than her actual therapist. I even made the comment, &#8220;I think he has a psych degree&#8221; lol.Now on to Stephan&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; he&#8217;s perfect! He is my dream boyfriend! He was dominant, controlling&#8230;.. but not overboard, in touch with his feelings, patient, listens, put your needs first, and HOT!!!!!! What more could you want. I even posted him as one of my top book boyfriends today. I don&#8217;t think Sherri could have written a more perfect man.I have spent a lot of time reading the third books of trilogies lately, and I have been increasing annoyed with authors. There have been several books where I felt as though the book was written just to make money. No angst. No climax. No plot. But this was not the case for this book! There was all of this and more! This is why this series sits on my ALL TIME FAVORITES LIST and has been reread several times.I was going to do favorite quotes and more&#8230;&#8230;. But I want you to read this book. I want you to experience it the way I experienced it. It is full of raw emotions, passion, lust and love. I don&#8217;t want to spoil that for you! Grab the book and then come discuss it with me!Rating: 5 StarsReviewed by Melissa :)",5.0

7091,"I bought this book because  the New York Times put it on its &#34;top ten&#34; list for 2013.  While the story is indeed about  an unconscionable tragedy, the way it is told did not affect this reader in what was anticipated to be a deeply emotional way.  Most of the book is about memories of her lost husband and sons and the author's inability to  find the &#34;appropriate&#34; way to grieve.  I tried to imagine myself going through this and I could not by living this through the author's eyes.  Numbness, yes, but some of her other reactions didn't follow what I thought would be a way to push through the horror - a yowling trudge through the devastation, connection with others who are grieving, a memorial service, anything but the numbness and, ultimately, drinking and contemplation of suicide.  So much of the rest of the book is about happier times with her children and husband - pictures would have been nice  so we readers felt more connected - which I get.  But it's the immediate aftermath and the weeks that follow that is the punch of this awful event.  Her guts are ripped out but at least this reader was not able to feel this with her.",3.0
7092,"We all know that Blackwater was a major private security contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan that was regularly accused of shooting civilians, overpaying its employees, and wasting the taxpayer's money.It turns out its founder and former president (he sold the company in 2010) was forbidden by his contract from talking to the media, but now he wants to set the record straight.His ghost writer should have urged Prince to tone down the hard-right, liberal-bashing rhetoric. It doesn't help his case, and plenty of conservatives denounced Blackwater. But Prince makes some good points. The Bush administration went to war with a firm goal of not inconveniencing American voters, so there was no conscription (resulting in a critical shortage of soldiers) and no tax increases (resulting in an unlimited supply of money -- the wars were financed entirely through borrowing which, at the time, no one protested). Private contractors were essential, and there was plenty of money to pay them.When the wars began going badly, few dared criticize our boys in uniform, but contractors were an easy mark. I tend to believe Prince's claim that Blackwater operated more efficiently than the military, that his employees weren't overpaid and didn't shoot civilians more often than coalition soldiers did, and that they did a reasonable job. He's not my sort of guy, but I learned a lot about private contractors and the difficulties of dealing with the government.",3.0

7097,"Minor League Baseball, the best family entertainment around (in my opinion), looks far different from the insiders&#8217; point-of-view.  As one who has rooted for the Chattanooga Lookouts, Tidewater (now Norfolk) Tides, San Antonio Missions, and El Paso Diablos, I was eager to read about what really takes place in the minors.  I had some inkling, thanks to a TV documentary on minor league umpires I&#8217;d seen.  Where Nobody Knows Your Name tells the stories&#8212;some heartbreaking, some inspiring&#8212;about those who aspire to make it to the Big League.  And not just the players; the managers, umpires, groundskeepers, broadcasters and players on rehab assignments (I would&#8217;ve liked to have known more about the agents).  The work ethic and drive to excel&#8212;to make it and get &#8220;sent up&#8221;&#8212;is dramatically detailed by sports writer John Feinstein.  He tells the stories of scores of people who hope one day to get to (in many cases back to) the Majors.  There is not a dull page in this book; every chapter is riveting and informative.In the Army we say the one thing you can count on is uncertainty.  Yet at least soldiers know that an average assignment is likely to be a steady three years.  I couldn&#8217;t believe the uncertainty of minor league baseball, the constant instability and pressure of not knowing if one&#8217;s job would be intact, the frequent moves to other teams, getting called up, then going back, and possibly leaving the game altogether.  Feinstein describes the vast differences between the lives of those in the major and minor leagues, and the (very) few who are content to stay in the Minors.  His book should make you think differently the next time you attend a minor league game.  This is an engrossing book by a masterful sportswriter, and a great book for the winter while waiting for Spring Training!",5.0

7106,"The story line was good.  Interesting and let me finish the full story.  It didn't have a great start but did have some nice elements. The macho hero and non-subservient heroine.The heroine is dragged into 1856 England by accident.  For a research scientist, she seemed pretty disinterested in the whole timemachine discovery by her 'date'.  No use was made of her expertise as such - which could have added more credibility to the character.**Spoiler**The jump back to 2012 - it seemed out of place and weird.  You would think if one were dragged from 1856 to 2012 the changes that have happened through history be baffling.  The author I guess didn't have another 100 pages to write about his acceptance and sort of rushed through to end the story.Basically good storyline .. could've been handled better.",3.0

While I might agree with the author's message, I found the prolonged way in which he tried to deliver the message annoying and difficult to concentrate on. I generally prefer condensed content and felt like the first eight chapters probably could've been told in one chapter. There are some good anecdotes and stories, but it just feels like Sowers repeats himself too much.All that said, the author's style might work just fine for you.

7124,"Moon Wreck - Secrets of Ceres follows the main characters as they fly to the asteroid Ceres. There they meet the companion ships of the one wrecked on the moon, and their occupants. A fleet of ships traveled from a distant solar system to protect Earth from an alien threat. A threat that will arrive in exactly 268 years. This statement gets repeated over and over. I&#8217;m not sure what bothers me, the fact that the date when the alien threat will discover Earth is so exact, or that this warning is flashed to the reader every other page. The reader quickly becomes desensitized of any reaction to the threat.Another disconcerting aspect is the character's interests. One is obsessed with weapons, so every other thought he has is about the possibility of seeing the ship's weapons. This guy only thinks about how much he misses his sister (or wife and kid, I can't keep it straight) and how much he wants to get his hands on alien weapons. That's it. He doesn't get hungry or tired, doesn't get frustrated with anything, just thinks about his sister and weapons. And how much he knows his friend wants to get back to his wife and kid. It's painful to read.",1.0

7127,"But for me it started loosing some of the good mystery and  momentum the first one had. Let me elaborate why:*** Minor spoilers follow ***First of all most of the interesting things are revealed except for the enemy who we can deduce is also Human as a species so most of the air is out of the balloon. Characters start surviving magically and although this is not exaggerated to the point of hilariousness situations which arise from this will sometimes feel a bit contrived. Also the fact that genetic treatment is almost instant and is utterly destructive when activated was a bit too hard for me to believe. How can genetic treatment undo brain wiring almost instantly, I would have expected the effects to be most noticeable in the next generation rather than the current one but I guess a tension point that was kind of relevant to the plot would not have existed if it would have gone my way.*** Minor spoilers end ***The author manages to create some interesting plot twists, the characters are already fleshed out but the twist in personality they experience to me wasn't believable or consistent, they sometimes seem bipolar.Also the author seemed to just mention some interesting situations, briefly detailing a (moral) choice that might have dire repercussions but never elaborates on the effects that might have had on the character or the world.Overall this second installment of the series does not seem so well fleshed out as the first one, it falls short of greatness but it's still an enjoyable quick read. I will finish the series despite the reviews which make it clear that problems foreshadowed in this second book will only be made worse in the third.I still liked this story a lot and some of the concepts, some of the events seemed a bit forced but it did not impact my overall enjoyment. I still feel I can't rate this book a maximum of five stars because it falls short of other works which do science fiction a bit better.I wish the author would have spent more time on the details, did more research and fine tuned the events a bit. Also he could have left more of a cliffhanger at the end by leaving something unresolved (SPOILER: like the plague which was an interesting plot device especially after the intervention of Janus, this would have fixed my gripe with the instant effectiveness of the treatment also /END SPOILER)",3.0

We don't get such a complete picture of the First Ladies in most stores covering the White House or the Presidents.  It was really interesting reading about all the decorating of the rooms and the seasonal decorations in the White House.  I hadn't known Bess Truman did more than appear at a few functions.  Didn't realize how energetic Mamie Eisenhower was and how well she treated those around her.  Always have to feel sorry for Pat Nixon with the way they left the Presidency.  I was glad none of the more unflattering behavior of President Kennedy was omitted from the book.  We were aware President Roosevelt had had polio but it's only in recent years we find out how dependent he was on others for activities of daily living.,5.0

I thought the author did an outstanding job of weaving faith and transformation into the story line in a very real and believable way.... something that not all authors are good at. I also liked that this book didn't give a fairy tail ending but rather one of true hope and challenge.",4.0
7137,"It&#8217;s been two weeks since Honor and her aunt Gina found out that Honor&#8217;s brother, Finn, was killed in Afghanistan and the book opens with them at his funeral. Honor&#8217;s supposed to leave for college the following day, but a letter from Finn that arrived three days before changes her plans. It&#8217;s the first letter she&#8217;d ever received from him, he preferred e-mail, and she hasn&#8217;t been able to bring herself to open it until now. Inside are tickets for one of her favorite singer&#8217;s final performance and Honor takes it as a sign that she should go because Finn wanted her to.Letting her aunt think she&#8217;s heading off to orientation in Austin as scheduled, Honor is just about ready to leave for the concert in California instead when Finn&#8217;s former best friend, Rusty shows up with a serious hangover (she&#8217;d seen him drinking from something in a brown paper bag at the funeral the day before), insists on going with her and proceeds to pass out in the passenger seat. She&#8217;d thought of dumping him at his father&#8217;s house, but his dad is a complete dick and Rusty, who helped Finn restore the Impala, which now belongs to her, could be helpful in the event of car troubles.I&#8217;m not going to go into great detail about the things that happened during their trip to California, but, as expected, Honor and Rusty don&#8217;t immediately hit it off since Rusty and Finn stopped being friends after Finn enlisted and he started acting like he hated Honor. The story mostly revolves around these two, but there are secondary characters we meet along the way, some who were in it very briefly (Wyatt surprised me in a good way), while others were in it a bit longer, but I thought they added to the story and gave us some insight into both Honor and Rusty.Even though Honor and Rusty already knew each other, &lt;i>In Honor&lt;/i> kind of reminded me of &lt;i>The Statistical Probability of Falling in Love&lt;/i>, though it was more serious and sad at times, especially when Honor was remembering Finn. This happened quite a bit throughout the book and I thought, like I said, it was sad, it was also very realistic. I did like the book, but there were a few problems I had that kept it from being one that I might&#8217;ve loved.First, Honor never returned Gina&#8217;s calls. After what happened with Finn, I would think that Gina would&#8217;ve been running to the police and some kind of alert would&#8217;ve been put out for the car, and it was mean of Honor to cause Gina and, I&#8217;m sure Honor&#8217;s best friend, to worry. Second, I was having to really suspend disbelief about a scene at the beach, which had a major impact on what happened with Honor&#8217;s plans. I also felt they got out of the resulting problems way too easily. And don&#8217;t get me started on the way Honor acted there. Up until that point I liked her, but I thought she acted like an immature ass, especially when she just wandered around moping about what she was going to do without trying to help Rusty (and she should&#8217;ve fessed up from the get-go). I just felt that the end was too rushed and should&#8217;ve had another chapter or two (it&#8217;s only 235 pages, as is). Finally, while we do find out why Finn enlisted and what made Rusty go to his funeral, we never found out *****spoiler*****  when or why Rusty and Finn ended up getting back in touch with each other, which I thought was a big omission. I also wondered why Gina couldn&#8217;t have helped with school and why they didn&#8217;t look into loans or scholarships*****end spoiler*****.Some of the things that led to what happened could&#8217;ve been explained, which would&#8217;ve made the book stronger. I also expected, and would&#8217;ve liked, a bit more romance (not hot sex scenes) in this book. I think I was disappointed with the lack of it because I was expecting more going into it, for some reason.Having said that, I did like &lt;i>In Honor&lt;/i> and Kirby did a good job making me feel what Honor was going through, how close she&#8217;d been to her brother and why they&#8217;d have done anything for each other. I thought the end, part of which some might see as a little too coincidental, was really cute and I was satisfied with it. Even with the problems I had with this book, I would recommend it, it was a fast easy read, I liked Kirby&#8217;s writing style and, while it wasn&#8217;t a light, happy book, I thought the storyline was original and different than most contemporary books I&#8217;ve read.",4.0
7138,This is one of the best books on perennials that I have! It starts out with getting started. Then how to pick the perfect perennials. When you are shopping for perennials to learn how to pick healthy plants. One thing to be careful of is to look at the tag on the perennial you are interested in. Some places will sell perennials from a zone that you are not in. I am in zone 5 and have picked a plant that belongs in zone 6. The plant will not last. Then designing your garden. Do this on graph paper first. Then when you have the plants to set them in place until you like the layout. Keeping your plants alive is an excellent part of this book!! Then you have each perriennial shown and described. This helps you to make decisions on what goes together in a planting group. Make sure if you are planting in full sun not to pick a plant that needs full shade or the other way around. Happy gardening with Perrenials for Every Purpose!!!!,5.0

For example, the story or characters didn't need a ""Clarence-like"" character to bring magic or mysticism to the story. Clarence' s roll could have been filled just as effectively by a kind-hearted neighbor. But that didn't overwhelm the solid story line, didn't take away from the characters.

7149,"I received a complimentary copy from the author in exchange for an honest review...so I can honestly say...I only finished this book because it was a gifted copy.Wow - I'm so put off and disturbed by the actions of the characters in this book I'm not sure I can continue reading the series. If you enjoyed Cheyenne and Dylan's HEA in When Snow Falls, you might not want to read this book. Cheyenne's on the train to Crazy Town and took Aaron and Presley with her. The whole Cheyenne/Dylan storyline is WRONG. Period. I can't believe the book ends the way it did with them. I thought this book would resolve the huge secret of Wyatt's paternity Cheyenne kept at the end of her book, but instead we're left with an even bigger secret - one that can't possibly bring her any kind of HEA. The Cheyenne/Dylan storyline bothered me so much that it really overshadows everything else in the book.So many characters in the book keeping secrets and lies, supposedly justified, but not really. In addition, the &#34;love&#34; story of Aaron and Presley didn't work for me. I didn't feel like they had chemistry. Even the &#34;big&#34; ending made Aaron look bad. I'm all for second chance romances, but in a lot of ways their original romance (such as it was) was more toxic than anything. I wish more focus had been on them working through their issues and trying to have a real relationship versus the &#34;let's have fun til you leave&#34; fling they chose. I also can't understand why we had the &#34;triangle&#34; with Riley either.  It was the same storyline from the previous book - just insert Riley instead of Eve.For being a contemporary romance, this book is a little dark and depressing for me.  I guess technically there is a &#34;HEA&#34;, but given the major cliffhangers, the book didn't feel complete and makes the HEA hard to accept because you know there is more to come. I tried to like Aaron and Presley's story, but this book just wasn't my cup of tea.",2.0

Very strong hiccup before conclusionSex Scenes: Yes but appropriate and not too graphic.Happy Ending: Um..yes. Kind of. They get together.Best Feature of story: Well written. The best friend was a great character.Worst Features of story Potentially should have a trigger warning. Was not the nice easy romance I thought it would be. In spite of the circumstances, `love' came possibly more quickly to the main characters than I'd have thought.Any supernatural elements: YesBest suited for:  It's not really a lazy read: the characters struggle towards their happy ending  - which is a different version of the happy I'm used to from this author. When you're in the mood for something a little more intense.Recommend to: People who prefer angst in their romances and like to suspend belief. It's not twilight  angst/supernatural though.

7177,"Have longed enjoyed psychological thrillers and unique characters, all which can be found in this story. Hector supplies the human side of this ghost hunt while the history of the old hotel and it's former occupants give you the paranormal side.There are several sub-plots, an excellent twist and leaves the reader thinking at the end, trying to put all the pieces together. A short read that leaves you wanting more.  Characters are well defined and pull you into the read.Every writer has their own style and I enjoyed the 'voice' of this writer. If you are looking for a quick, entertaining read, may I suggest this story.",5.0
7178,"Teen Spirit makes for a quick, cute read. You won't find any of the &#34;heavy&#34; in these pages or sexy times, it is the prefect book for the young teenage crowd. The pace was pretty much the same throughout the book, I wasn't bored but I wasn't emotionally involved if that makes sense.The parts I did find very entertaining and funny were the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' references throughout the book. If you like to read about ghost and spirits then give this book a try. Based in the Beverly Hills area, so get read for the 'Mean Girls' issues like expected because of the area book takes place and school. And if you have a Ouija board at home, you might want to keep it away while you read Teen Spirit.Overall, a fast teen read that will connect with the younger crowd better than my old age self.",2.0
7179,"Wilde Riders is a fun and charming story about a country boy turned hot shot wall street man and a girl who works with wall street guys and wants nothing to do with them. Which results in truths being avoided but also results into some very good [steamy] scene. :)Wilde Riders is told in the POV of both main characters, Cooper and Riley. The chapters switch back and forth between the two. Which is always good, it gives you so much insight into the main characters and in my opinion helps you feel more connected to both characters and not just one. Talking about characters.. I really enjoy them all! After reading Wilde Riders I have been having a sweet book tooth for the rest of the books in the series, I can't wait to sink my book teeth into them. I not only felt connected to Cooper and Riley...************[&#34;I guess I'm not like most guys.&#34;&#34;There are very few ways in which you're like most of the guys I know&#34;(Wilde Riders 'Cooper and Riley')]**********as I read I also could feel the emotions play out between them and Cooper's brothers.**********[When He looks back at me, his eyes are moist.It breaks my heart.&#34;What girl's ever gonna want me?

It was a great start to a new promising series by Savannah Young. The story line was well written and flow perfect together. And that epilogue ending was amazing!! I loved every second of it.All in all Wilde Riders was a fun sexy read. I loved every line and page in the book until the very end. Would I recommend this read? Heck to the Yes I recommend this read to all NA/Adult romance fans this read will crave your Sweet Book Tooth. :DMust Read!!!!",5.0
7180,I enjoyed this installment of the prequel to Enders Game. There is plenty of action to move the plot along. The epilogue is a cliffhanger of sorts.

7184,"This book hooked me from the first page and didn't let up the entire time! Tanner Zane is a computer programmer. His company gives all their employees a two-month paid sabbatical after they've been there for seven years, so his is just beginning. He's on his way to Phoenix to pick up his parents and they're going to take a leisurely tour of the Pacific Coast. However, when he gets to their home, he's stunned to see them blindfolded, gagged and bound to chairs and then he's grabbed from behind and faints.When he wakes up, he finds himself bound to a chair in his parents' garage. He's told that his cooperation depends on whether his parents will live or not and is told that he needs to do some hacking for them. He's taken to a remote location where he meets the &#34;Dream Team,&#34; aka the &#34;Starting Five&#34;: Charles, Michael, Magic, Patrick and (a couple of days later, the boss) Larry.In his college years, Tanner was a hacker until something happened that shook him up and made him stop. He then found religion and changed his ways. He had promised not to hack anymore, but his captors didn't care about that--they just wanted results. They hurt him and threatened him and he started to work with them. I felt that Tanner was up to something but couldn't figure it out. There are some great twists and turns which kept me quickly turning the pages to find out what would happen next.This is one of those books that will make you think about your online presence. I like to think I'm careful but I know I've had lapses in judgment and posted things that I wanted to take back later. Tanner explains some of the things people do that make them vulnerable to identity theft. This book also shows how easy it is to exploit people in their personal lives to get them to do what you want, like finding someone in financial trouble or starting a relationship with someone who is looking for their soul mate. I also love that all of it was explained in a simple way that anyone (even me) can understand.There is mention of religion and how it's changed Tanner's life, but there's no preaching, so anyone interested in a fast-paced, thrilling book will enjoy this one! There's also a touch of romance. While thinking that I want to read more, I realized that Denver Acey wrote The Utah Code Breaker, which is a book I've had on my Kindle for a while now and also features Tanner Zane, and now I am looking forward to reading that book as well. And I hope Mr. Acey is planning even more books in the future!I received a copy of this book to review. My opinion is 100% my own.",5.0

7189,"I got a review copy of this from Cleis. My 6 year old son looked at the cover and said, what's that about? Jackson Galaxy? No? Catwoman?Well, not quite - but this is a solid collection of fiction - it fits well into the women's erotica collection genre, reminding me of the Herotica series and of course earlier editions, as it has a broad range of scenarios and preferences, all creatively imagined.Of course, not all stories appealed to me, but I suppose this is the way a collection should be - something for everyone means that not all stories will appeal to everyone, us being all different ones, as we are. So I think the best way to review a collection is to point out what you like, as one woman's meat, etc.The first story, Out in the Open by Oleander Plume, has a pleasing twist. Tamsin Flowers' story 'I Hate Sex; is worth it for the title alone, but it's a story of reawakening that rings very true. Ingrid Luna's 'The Cake' jolted me out of any complacency I might have been feeling regarding the familiarity of the stories - it's the first time I've been shocked by a story in quite a while, and for that in itself, it demands a round of applause. I liked 'Monsoon Season', by Valerie Alexander a lot - a heartfelt and sexy story of femdom and understated feelings that ends in quiet communication and honesty. 'Marylou' by Lucy Debussy is a breath of liberation - there's a joyfulness to it in terms of its expression of both feminine and masculine desire that seems enormously positive - it didn't go how I thought it might, it was far better. Nikki Adams 'Chrysalis' is touching, an appealing story of gender preferences that adds a mature tilt to the book. Rose de Fer's 'Nyotaimori' is beautifully and evocatively written, an Asian story of being a serving plate for sushi - I'm pretty sure there's an official expression for that - it might even be in the story, but you can find out yourself, as it hasn't stuck with me. And, ultimately, this collection ends with a sweet and naughty little retro barbershop tale from Alison Tyler that's worth the price of the book alone. Love it!",4.0

7195,"5 STARSI couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.  I was hooked on the book by the end of chapter one and by the time I hit chapter 4 I was engrossed.  Any reservations I had about the hot guy that would make you swoon left as soon as I met AJ.  I just wish that there was more of him in the book.  He's a pivotal character in the book and one of my favorites but he's only one of the love interests for Nardia.Nardia is a senior nurse at the hospital, which is where a majority of this story takes place.  She has the ability to heal people with just a touch, but she can't go around healing everyone or people would find out her secret.  Usually she knows when she's suppose to heal someone other times she has to be told.  Besides being able to heal people she's unable to die and has been around for about 392 years.  She doesn't remember anything about her childhood before she woke up in St. Giles in a abandoned building.Regan is Dr. at the hospital that Nardia works at.  He's attractive and the other love interest of Nardia's but there's something about him that I don't like.  He seems like the perfect gentleman and a good guy.  Regan becomes close to the new Dr. who starts at the hospital.  He really seems to admire him and is constantly talking about Dr. Jeffries and singing his praises to Nardia.  When I first me Dr. Jeffries I had an instant dislike of him and by the time I reached the end of the book I knew why.AJ is considering purchasing the coffee shop that Nardia frequents on a daily basis.  He and Nardia have an instant attraction to one another.  She's the reason he's there and considering buying the coffee shop.  The reason behind that will be revealed later on in the book.  AJ is definite swoon worthy material.  He can cook, makes awesome coffee, a great lover, and when he sings he has the ability to bring back memories of Nardia's past.  The past she doesn't remember.Aria Williams thank you so much for this book.  You drew me into the story and I became so engrossed that I lost all track of time.

7207,"\\ Review originally posted on The Book Addict's Guide //Completed: August 7, 2013Publishing Info: May 4th 2010 by Brilliance AudioSource: Digital audio borrowed from my local library (12 CDs/14 hrs, 42 mins)Audio Narrators: Kevin R. Free, Katherine KellgrenGenre: Fantasy, mythology, paranormalPOV: First Person (Alternating between Sadie & Carter)I was actually a little nervous going into THE RED PYRAMID as my first book for Classics Retold, not because of the size or the content, but because it&#8217;s really more of a middle grade book than young adult and I haven&#8217;t read anything that could be classified as middle grade since Harry Potter. THE RED PYRAMID kind of dances along the line of middle grade and young adult with our main characters Carter and Sadie Kane at 14 and 12-years-old (respectively). The only major difference I would say for the age range is that there&#8217;s only a touch of romance and it&#8217;s definitely not a main focus of the book, although Carter&#8217;s crush does end up playing a significant role.Okay! Now that we have that all cleared up&#8230; Let&#8217;s talk about the content. So for Classics Retold, I&#8217;m hosting the Mythology portion and I chose Egyptian mythology specifically to read for the challenge/project. THE RED PYRAMID seemed like the natural choice as my first read because it was the only title I could come up with off the top of my head full of Egyptian mythology and not just a retelling of Cleopatra or Nefertiti (although I would love to read those as well)! Rick Riordan is no slouch when it comes to backing up his imagined situations with real Egyptian myths, gods, and legends. Besides the ones I already knew, I actually learned about quite a few more gods as well as how they came into being, according to their legends. I also trusted Riordan quite a bit in accepting their histories as true since it seemed that most of the backstories were the actual Egyptian legends and then the story that was happening in present time was the actual book&#8217;s plot involving those &#8220;characters&#8221;.THE RED PYRAMID is actually quite a hefty book (the hardcover is listed at 516 pages and the audio was almost 15 hours&#8230; I usually listen to books that about 7, to give you an idea of my usual attention span) but it really didn&#8217;t feel terribly long! I did feel the length, but I was actually enjoying all of the content. I really, really enjoyed all of the connections to Egypt: the myths, the actual locations, the language&#8230; It all really fascinates me! I&#8217;ve always been incredibly interested in Egypt (maybe that&#8217;s why I watch The Mummy every time I pass it on TV&#8230;) and I think it would be amazing to see history as ancient as that still standing!Rick Riordan, aside from great content, also created some really lovable characters. The banter between Carter and Sadie is hilarious. Carter is a bit more reserved, but Sadie (even at 12) is a bit rebellious and out-spoken so her comments to Carter as a typical, bratty younger sister really cracked me up! I really enjoyed watching their brother-sister relationship grow and change as they face some serious obstacles together.I think the ending could have wrapped up juuuust a bit quicker but I really enjoyed the book overall! Will I be continuing the series? I&#8217;m not quite sure. While I really enjoyed THE RED PYRAMID, I&#8217;m already finding out that I get burned out on mythology really quickly if I read them back-to-back. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to revisit it in a few months!",4.0

At times I was crying, at times I was giggling, and at other times I wanted to reach in the book and strangle both Olivia and Mr. Burnham.

T K definitely named this book correctly, the love story truly hits the tragic level, I pushed thru and was rewarded. If you have not read A Beautiful Mess, I recommend you do and fall in love with Olivia and Alexander so you can follow them on their royally messed up and tragic journey thru love and discovery. I can't wait for the final book. Awesome job T K another book I will love forever :)Gorgeous Chaos (Beautiful Mess Book 3) (Kindle Edition)This book is another hit for T. K. Leigh.

7221,"This was my first Pressfield book, and now I'm looking forward to many more.While sometimes heavy with description, Pressfield has an impressive, poetic kind of prose that I found, after adjusting to it, incredibly drawing. I liked the angle he took with the book, having a slave, essentially, take the role of narrator. While having Xerxes at the beginning makes it obvious what's going to happen at the end, I think it moved the story momentum forward, instead of deflating it.Where I think most of Pressfield's strengths lie in this book was not only the strong historical aspect, but his characters. I loved Leonidas. As a soliders wife, he made me proud to have some kind of similarity with the Spartan women, as in-line as it may or may not have been. This is a story packed with intensity, grief, and emotion, but not in a way that drained me as a reader.I'm looking for Pressfields next book now!",5.0
7222,"Well, it was bound to happen. The author who thrilled us old farts with stories of space travel, filled with personalities, plots, sub-plots and even sexuality has finally had a good biography written about his personal life. Hearing how his personal life in some ways paralleled what he wrote about (naturism, open marriage) was something new for me and added context to his writing.This is a very detailed biography, of a very interesting man, one who was probably outside of his time and yet who was the defining author of his time for fantasy and science fiction. If you have never read his books, this will be an uninteresting and tedious read...if, like me, you were a fan of Heinlein from the time of literacy, through puberty and into adulthood, this will be page after page of interesting stuff and this is only volume 1.Which is the most disappointing part....that there is a second volume to come, covering his most popular works and times.

7223,"This review will not contain spoilers, you need to read it yourself to see the beauty of the story.This book is not a kind, fluffy, feel good, sappy read - at least in the first 50 pages. Is a gripping, grab your seat, emotional, raw, gritty prelogue and prologue. It contains &#34;distressing&#34; content that may be offensive to some readers. With that said here are my words.I loved this book. I cried, ugly tears. It was an emotional roller coaster that kept me reading until I was forced to put it down. Written beautifully in the first person, the reader actually feels the experiences that Allyn feels. Being drawn into her character you feel her pain and anguish.Now to the story - Allyn is a normal young woman who lives a simple life. She works at a clothing store and enjoys life full of color and carefree. That all ends one day, in a horrific crime that leaves her all but dead. Amazingly she survives, only to live in emotional hell. She can't leave her house, accept any sort of human contact except her doctor and her parents. Cuts off all interaction to the human world outside of her door. She is in self induced prison. Her whole world is bland, boring, beige... One day she sees a doctor on TV that she thinks could help her more than her doctor for 3 years. She calls desperately trying to get an appointment with him to come to her house. He finally agrees. That's when she sees a blue-jay outside her window... it gives her hope.

Luke would try to scare her, and of course Dallas just LOVED that.Another thing that threw me was the deep-seated devotion they would have for one another one moment and then one false move and they were broken up. How can you tell someone you love them and won't even try to work it out? However, I did find the ending very interesting.

So every third generation, when we no longer remember what our grandfather's experienced, we go into one of these periods where the wealthy get very, very wealthy and the rest of us go under water.  The economic royalists take over until we elect a Teddy or a Franklin, along with supportive congresspeople, and unwrap our fetters.  The crash is coming soon. We'd better get out and vote.Funny thing is, right after I listened to Hartmann, I got a long email from some business adviser who says the same thing, that the dollar will lose its value within a year or so.

I liked Emma and Remy, both funny, smart, well-crafted characters. I loved the spy angle and I'm a sucker for a mystery. And I rooted for the story to come to the predictable end. And though I say the end was predictable, this is not to the story's detriment for me because even though I may know (or at least suspect) where the story and the characters are headed, it's how they get there and what happens in-between that is most interesting to me.I cannot compare this to other Robin DeHart books but if anyone is looking for a quick, delightful read, No Ordinary Mistress will not disappoint.",4.0

There is  the story of  the revolt of certain characterscreated by the author and their plot to kill the authorin order to ""stop the story"" and thus stop the war. There is  the story of three generationsliving together in a house in Vermont,the narrator, his daughter and his granddaughter,each with his (or her) own memories, loss and sorrow,hope and resilience.The only frame that may unite these stories is the darkness that fills a room duringa long sleepless night.The darkness as a source of creativityfor insomniac people.But  it is written with real talent and makes me wish to read otherbooks by Paul Auster.

7252,"Reviewed by PattiBook provided by a contest at The Romance ReviewsReview originally posted at Romancing the BookWerewolves, witches, romance, and suspense this book has many great things to recommend it. The Lycan Moon is a great story all the way around. I am hoping that some of the secondary characters come back in future titles of their own. It took me a few chapters to get into it because I have been reading a lot of erotica lately and this has a completely different focus. Once I got into it though I enjoyed the story a lot. It was a refreshing change of pace for me. The romance is interwoven into the story. The Lycan Moon has substance; it is not a case of a romance novel where the book is a bunch of mating scenes with filler.The back story for The Lycan Moon has a nice little twist. I enjoyed the mix of witchcraft and werewolf mythology. Having the additional interaction added another level to the legend. Calen is definitely a character I was pulling for throughout the book. Long tortured heroes get me all the time. Dana has a tenacity that just makes you love her. I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions between them. I also think that there is potential for this author to go forward if she chose to make this book part of a series. I will be looking for more books by S. Durham and hopefully she will take me on some other fun journeys.",4.0
7253,"I found this book pretty disappointing after giving Tangled Tides 5 stars. It was ok, but it felt sort of like filler.There was no expansion on the mythology, besides learning of Harte's existence, but I felt like it didnt really add anything to the story. There was no added depth to Yara and her people. It was just a detour to rescue Vienna and return back to the story. I dont know if Vienna will be important in the next installment, or if saving her was just so that we could see Rownan get an HEA too.And I didnt really like Harte either. It felt like it was never going to end and I couldnt wait for them to get out of there. It took way too long. But I still enjoy the characters, and I especially enjoyed seeing a different side of Rownan. I never would have suspected what kind of relationship him and Treygan had from their behaviour in book 1.So, this wasnt a bad little adventure, but it was less than I was expecting.

7259,"I was skeptical at first. I found this when looking for books to soften the blow of the HBO series True Detective ended.  I don't remember where but one of the books on the list is in this collection. I am fine with mysteries, ok with detective stories, but was not up for a detective story that also throws in romance.  After reading a bit I was worried.  This book really doesn't go into the mysterious areas where True Detective went.  Glad I kept going, because at the end I was frantically searching for more books in the series. What this series lacks in the way of the backwater Louisiana strangeness I was hoping for it makes up for in flat out suspense and fear.  My first instinct was I know a lot of Kent Harbinger's and avoid them like the plague.  Keep reading if this happens to you.  I can't believe this but by the end of the first book I started thinking that if I had to sit with him at a table while attending a wedding I could make it at least through dinner.  By the end I was able to see him as a force for good, although the wake of destruction he leaves is messy.  Great series, hope there is more of the exploits of the degenerate genius that is Kent Harbinger.",5.0

7268,"I seriously just loved every single thing about this book. I was hooked within the first few chapters. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. There is action, romance, humor, SMUT, threats. The Curse Keepers had absolutely everything I need in a good book.At first Ellie did get on my nerves a bit, but I held out faith that she would pick it up. And thankfully in the end she did. Ellie has her moments of weakness, but my goodness she&#8217;s faced some s***, it&#8217;s allowed. For the most part she&#8217;s a strong heroine who has a lot of strength.While I was falling in love with Ellie I couldn&#8217;t figure out Collin, our hero. Was he a good guy, a bad guy, just misunderstood??? I couldn&#8217;t decide. Truthfully I still can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m starting to lean toward misunderstood, but you never know. The author, could be a horrible person who intends to rip our hearts out and stomp on them by making us fall in love with a guy only to turn him. And she could too, because I&#8217;m pretty sure regardless of Collin&#8217;s good/bad guy status I love him a little.  He&#8217;s just so protective of Ellie. While he makes some mistakes&#8230; some BIG mistakes you can tell that he really wants to keep her safe. The question is if she&#8217;ll let him or not. I&#8217;m getting all goose bumpy just writing about this again.The secrets and questions that take place in this book are done in such a way that you have to keep reading so you can find out the answers. Sometimes a book will take it too far and the unknowns just become annoying and actually pull me out of the reading, but that is not a problem in The Curse Keepers. We&#8217;re given just enough information to keep us wrapped up in the story without being able to figure it out earlier than we should.  My notes are littered with incorrect questions and guesses to what was going to happen. But this is also a series so some of my theories will press on until the end. I swear I have one of them figured out.. really I do&#8230;. maybe&#8230; probably not. I haven&#8217;t been right on much so far. :)I went into this read thinking it was a little YA. Then I heard from the author that it wasn&#8217;t entirely chaste, but I&#8217;ve read a lot of erotica lately so I didn&#8217;t think it would be enough. Again I was wrong. This book isn&#8217;t erotica by any means, but there is some good sexual tension brewing between these two. And yes, we even get a little bedroom action in there. It&#8217;s good action too, I was a happy reader.Truly when I tell you this book had a little bit of it all I am not kidding. There is mystery, suspense, humor, action, and a little lovin&#8217;. I will say the ending is brutal, I wanted to cry. Sitting here thinking about the ending makes me all sad and weepy again. I hope this is fixed in the next book because I can&#8217;t handle it. But that&#8217;s not all it includes. As is my duty, I have to warn you this book ends in a CLIFFHANGER! I was so tore up I can&#8217;t even discuss the ending.  I had to start the second book, The Curse Breakers, immediately. I&#8217;m working my way through that one now and am already freaking out that there will be another cliffhanger. This is a three book series, but the final book doesn&#8217;t come out until September. September, people! How will I ever make it that long?Anyway, go, go right now and one-click The Curse Keepers.

7275,"To read this book is to begin to understand the all-pervasive nature of Hinduism in India, not only culturally and politically but also geographically.  India serves literally as a spiritual map for pious pilgrims for whom daily life is constant ritual.  Perhaps more than any other religious practitioners, Hindus see divinity virtually everywhere, so they can worship a bewildering array of gods and goddesses, with their multiple names and personalities every day, no matter where they happen to be situated in that vast, variegated nation.Hindus don't have to leave India to do pilgrimages because the entire country is a pilgrimage site.  Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma are everywhere.  Using the ancient scripts and old-fashioned detective-style footwork, Diane Eck explores the macro- and micro-geography of Indian Hinduism, piecing together its numerological system as well as examining mythical and real mountains, rivers and other geographic features that Hindus employ to navigate their spiritual lives.  And she explains what lingums and yonis really represent as opposed to the popular understanding of these omnipresent symbols.This is the first Diana Eck book I've read, and I must say I find her thorough, passionate, lucid, and poetic.  She embraces a vast subject and explicates it well, whetting your appetite for more, although at times I said to myself, too much information!  It is not a judgmental book, but she also touches on more disturbing aspects of Hinduism, like the caste system and animal sacrifice, that (in my opinion) are no longer acceptable in our arguably more humane world.In short, this is a book to be consumed in small bites and read more than once.  But it is apparently the culmination of a life-time of studying Indian spirituality, so it is dense with fact and myth.  As someone who plans a prolonged trip to India soon, I appreciate Eck's efforts to elucidate what makes India India, so distinctive from any other country.",5.0
7276,"Just like the lead female character, Wren Caswell, this book is too average for my liking. If Disney tried to water down (and I mean really dilute) Cruel Intentions, you might get The Promise of Amazing. It ranks smack in the middle of tepid &#34;meh&#34; for me. Perhaps, The Promise of Amazing is better suited for middle-schoolers. This teen angst love story doesn't have the drama, love, emotion or wit that I'm looking for from this genre. Nothing major happens to divide or bind the characters. Okay, so the synopsis presents potential, but the emotional punch is completely lacking. This could be categorized as 'sweet,' but at no point did I feel invested in the characters or concerned about their situation and outcome. When that happens, something is missing from the writing, the message is not being conveyed.I'm afraid the passive strategy backfires in this one. Wren comes across as whiny and weak. Her insecurity never develops into anything more than luck. She does nothing to promote the outcome besides hanging around and continuing with her usual routine. Gray does the most changing and all because of love?  He really doesn't experience much pressure to change, he just decides it's the right thing to do. A bit of blackmail occurs, but really it never becomes a major threat because when the truth is revealed, acceptance follows with very little tension. The Promise of Amazing is not delivered.",2.0

7280,"Following the success of his first book, The Tourist Killer, FC Etier has released his second, The President&#8217;s Club, in installments on Venture Galleries. When completed, the author will self-published it in digital book form. A good serials does not always a good book make, but in this case, it works out pretty well.Julian Thibault is a wealthy, powerful man whose life is in constant danger. He has a crack security team, but when things get a little out of hand, he calls John Hixon, former FBI agent, out of his mountain retreat to help him out. In The President&#8217;s Club, Thibault asks Hixon to protect the seven members of the club of the same name. The author does not rely on goriness, crassness, or graphic details to keep the reader guessing from the beginning to end, relying instead on tight writing, unexpected plot twists, and making it clear from the get-go that none of his characters, however beloved, are safe.In this second book of The Barry-Hixon Conspiracy, FC Etier brings us more intrigue, conspiracy theories, and intricate political web-weaving. If you haven&#8217;t read its predecessor, The Tourist Killer, don&#8217;t worry, as The President&#8217;s Club also makes for a good standalone book. It is a little harder at the beginning to try to keep up with all the characters and the plotlines, but the author makes sure to underline, in one way or another, the details from the first book important to know to understand what is going on in the second one.One element of FC Etier&#8217;s writing which I appreciate are the well thought-out details and the well placed humor. Three in particular stand out. The first is that the book is named after a group of seven older men who happen to all be named after a former President of the United States. The second was a mention of the fiftieth anniversary of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy&#8217;s assassination. The last one is in a conversation between two characters in the book, the first mentioning that he loves reading, only to be encouraged by the other to read The Tourist Killer, the author of which is a friend.I also liked that the plot in The President&#8217;s Club, a fast paced story not for the faint at heart, felt a bit like a commentary on how big egos crumble strong alliances that could otherwise make a huge positive impact on the world. As a member of a strong alliance, Thibault is trying to make such a positive change. However, both the individual and society have to change together, with the help and guidance of institutions. And while both Thibault and society want positive change, the ideals of the alliance  Thibault belongs to are greatly tainted by egos, making for a powerful destructive force.As I read about the various sub-alliances collide one against the other, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of how governance seems to often be about different factions wanting to be correct &#8212; i.e. win the fight &#8212; rather than different groups with different ideas coming together to consult about progress. The infighting in The President&#8217;s Club becomes deadly, an interesting metaphor for the death of great movements and initiatives.Just like with The Tourist Killer, The President&#8217;s Club needs some ironing, as some awkward scene changes and plot transitions break the otherwise good flow of the book, which a quick reread clears it all up. And yet again, I would have liked more character development; it would have made for an even more thought-provoking read. Despite this, The President&#8217;s Club will keep you turning pages well into the night and make you look forward to future installments of The Barry-Hixon Conspiracy series.",4.0

7284,"I thought I would read this because I enjoy the dolls, and I figured it would be a good way to get to know more about the characters. It was actually a lot better than I was expecting.I was expecting some poorly written tween fan-fiction-esque book. While the characters act entirely like high school girls (which I guess is a good thing, since they are in High School), which leads to shallowness and cattiness; they are well-developed. The story is pretty good, there needs to be a little more about the relationship between the RADs and the Normies, but it gives enough to be solid.Probably not something a non-Monster High fan would want to reads, but for fans (teens and adults alike, it is a little complex for children) it's worth a go.",4.0
7285,"Selene Warren is an attractive 20-something who runs a yoga studio and hangs out with her college bffs.  She&#8217;s leading a safe, uncomplicated, quiet life with her cat, and dating a safe, uncomplicated, extremely handsome guy she loves but isn&#8217;t in love with.  She and the bffs have a coven where they play at magic, but mostly for entertainment.  One day a handsome stranger that only she can see shows up at her studio, her grandmother is brutally attacked and her life takes a sudden turn into loud and complicated.I waffled a lot while reading this book.  I almost ditched it about a third of the way in because of the paranormal elements (elves, halve elves, vampires, guardians, on and on and on); I like my paranormal a little more plausible; this was reminiscent of the Twilight series, and that didn&#8217;t really do it for me.  There was something about Selene and the handsome stranger, however, that kept me reading.I found the bffs to be one-dimensional.  Sure they all have separate paranormal strengths, and an unbreakable bond due to their &#8220;outsiderness;&#8221; I wanted to like them, but they came across as only a frame for Selene.  I was interested by that hint of odd-woman-out and would have liked to see it explored more.  I also wanted to know more about what made each of them tick.  Also, the cat disappeared about halfway through, and I spent the rest of the book wondering what happened to it and why it never entered her thoughts.There are some interesting subthemes about racism, politics, and self-acceptance, and I was drawn in by the growing relationship between Selene and Cheney, the handsome not-so-stranger.  I did enjoy seeing Selene grow into her talents, and find a backbone.  This was an ok book for me &#8211; well written, moderately likeable characters, average plot.  If you like fantasy mixed in with a little mystery, this might be the story for you.  I see there are more in the series &#8211; will I read them?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it was well-written enough that I will probably check out some of the author&#8217;s other work.",3.0

7292,"3 1/2-4 stars.  This one is hard for me to give a rating to.  I pre-ordered this, and have been anxiously awaiting its release for what seems like FOREVER.  I think all of the excitement of its release may have made it difficult for any book to live up to the expectation I had for it.  ""Feral Sins"", the first book to this series, is one of my all-time favorite shifter stories, and a couple of other books from this author are on my favorites shelf.  I think I set the bar of expectations higher for this series than I would with most other authors' works, instead of judging the books on their individual merits.  That said, if this was by most other authors, for most other series, I probably would have given it 4-5 stars.  Don't get me wrong--I feel it is written very well (like I expected), was super spicy (like I expected), and visited with characters from previous books (liked I expected).  What I didn't expect was how much I liked the hero Nick--knowing the premise of the story, I was expecting to dislike him in the beginning, but I enjoyed how his character worked to get into Shay's good graces.  I also enjoyed how Shay was able to hold Nick off for quite a while in the beginning--not the usual ""I hate you, but since we're fated mates I will forgive you as soon as you come near me--THAT was refreshing.  I still love the quirky one-liners, and entertaining dialogue I have come to expect with this series.  I did think though, that the suspense and action parts of the book were not as exciting as I was expecting--it kind of fell a little flat for me--that was a little disappointing.  I am a HUGE fan of Suzanne Wright--I feel she is an amazingly talented writer--and even though it wasn't my favorite, I do think this was a nice continuation of this series' storyline.  I will definitely read the next one!",4.0

The best thing about this piece isn't the pleasant delivery, the accuracy of information or the ease of absorption; the best part is how Platt and Truant lay out THEIR exact methodology for becoming a successful self-published author. The 'instructions' in this book are already proven - by the authors. Don't reinvent the wheel, just follow their lead. It isn't easy, but it IS simple.I loved this work. Thanks, guys.",5.0

7298,"Accidentally Evil is #3.5 in the Accidentally Yours series by Mimi Jean Pamfiloff.  First, I just have to say this...OH...MY...GOSH!!!Ok, I got that out of the way.  I feel better.  This is a short novella concentrating on the evil brother of the Gods, Chaam.  Chaam is the god of male virility.  He has spent 70,000 years helping others but he himself is alone and lonely.  He has given up hope that he will someday meet his own soul mate, until one day in 1934 when Chaam finds the beautiful Margaret O'Hare lost and unconscious in the jungles of Mexico.  He instantly falls in love with this beautiful woman.  But the most perplexing thing is that he is able to touch her.  How can this be possible?  Usually mortals cannot endure the touch of a God.Margaret wakes up to see the most beautiful man she has ever seen.  Who or what is he?  Her father has been missing for three days and she has been searching for him but has no idea what happened to her.This novella explains the events that took Chaam from being a God falling in love for the first time, to the evil Chaam that we meet in book one.  And, of course, Cimil is involved.  Right now I am shocked beyond belief at Cimil's actions.  I want to believe that there is a reason she orchestrated the events of this book but right now I want to hate her.  I guess the only thing to do is to continue on to book four.",5.0
7299,"I have been on a journey of physical self-healing since 2009, of which took considerable time and research to collate all the necessary information to integrate such into my daily life. The learning curve duration was two years, and of course - some subjects were studied more closely than others, achieving sheer mastery in some areas, and touching the surface in others. What is so notable in &#34;The Power of A Self-Healing&#34; is the vast collation of information that brings the more physical aspects of self-healing into integrated synthesis. As I read on through this well researched book, I commenced some self-talk on how much time this would have saved me, had this book been published at the beginning of my journey. Although, as I said, I have entered into some subjects with more intense study, &#34;The Power of Self-Healing&#34; nonetheless gives one a vast overview of the entire process, allowing you to picture where you are moving forward into with mental clarity, rather than blundering through in the dark, hoping all the threads you are seizing are leading you to a desired end result. My own end result has been fabulous, giving me an entirely new outlook on life. Even on days I choose to indulge and throw out my new rule book, it is so much easier to get back on track, and I know deeply within me that I have not abandoned the path, as my knowledge of all that is good is so great, this simply would never happen, and I know the effects of over indulgence.The chapter on Self-Healing Foods was so familiar, as this is the main area I have studied for two years. It is an imperative consideration, as it is the most opportune way by which we can heal our body, through the regular consumption of healthy food, preferably organic. Each type of whole natural food has particular nutrients - offering you a vast array of areas that can be healed within your body. The chapter on Anti-Healers advises you what to leave out of your diet in order to heal your body, which is a very important point. Within the two years of transforming my diet, I have learnt that sometimes you simply need to leave out certain types of foods, such as fried food. Self-Healing Supplements is a chapter covering a vast array of supplementation that you may possibly not have heard of. I have taken many of the supplements mentioned, such as digestive enzymes, and know of their effectiveness. Active Healing, the chapter that follows discusses the power of exercise to heal the body. The balancing effect is priceless through the production of serotonin, T Cell rebalancing, and strengthening of every part of the body. There are sections for yoga, Pilates etc. The New Healing Arts chapter discusses Reiki, Aromatherapy, different types of massage and their unique benefits, and much more. Further chapters cover the belief in healing that creates the power for healing to actualise, emotional healing and the 21 day program for self-healing.",5.0

7310,"I wanted to like this novel more than I actually did. I struggled with the first couple of chapters until I realized that the reason I wasn't getting into it was because it had been ages since I read the original story - I only remembered the plot faintly.  Thankfully, my copy included the original in the back.  I stopped reading the novel, read the original, and then went back to where I left off. Much better. I conclude that to enjoy Hyde at all, one must be familiar or have a fresh acquaintance with the source material.Levine's prose is atmospheric, lyrical and at times visceral. There is no doubt that he is skilled in recreating, even enhancing, the world Stevenson created. In Levine's hands, Hyde the character becomes more layered, even sympathetic. Telling the story from his point of view is a genius idea and what drew me to this book in the first place. Despite the creativity and the writing however, I was left with some dissatisfaction - characters and subplots are introduced and then abandoned, leaving me to wonder about their fates; there are unsavory passages that made me feel like I was wading through garbage just to get to follow the plot.",4.0

7319,"The book is inspiring and optimistic about the ability to dramatically reduce work time and increase leisure time.  There are a lot of good ideas presented and some good information on finding staffing for your part time businesses. My issue is with how much time you would have to devote to starting up the businesses that, once they are humming along, would allow you the leisure time that is the goal here.  It appears the author had several of these ""run themselves "" businesses before he semi-retired. What about most of us who work full time for somebody else and want to leave it behind?  Do we have to spend years of full time work trying to set up these businesses that will generate passive income? The author doesn't answer this, but I expect the answer is yes. So the advice really seems limited to those who are already well along in running their own businesses and can simply let someone else do it now.  For the rest of us, it's probably a lot of work getting to that point.",4.0

But there was something disturbingly different about Alice and her adventures with food that had odd effects, and what she saw and did after her fall into the rabbit hole.  That was one of the many books that were parodied in this story, and it also made me uncomfortable, like I was watching someone's bad trip with hallucinatic drugs.I pushed myself to read the entire book, just to see if there are hidden gems or laughs that made this entertainment.  But the further I read, the stranger it got, and by the end, I just wanted to escape from this book.  It was quirky, and even a bit humorous to start, but started down a darker path, and just became 'out of control'.

7322,"I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.&#34;Training Season&#34; is an excellent book with compelling characters, and the story kept pulling me back into its grasp even when I'd set it down and was going about my regular day.  There is emotional depth, flashes of humor, realistic struggles, and personal growth all wrapped together in a well-written book.Matty Marcus, a champion figure skater, has suffered both physical injuries and emotional pain for his sport.  As a gay man who does not hide who he is, he wrestles with injustice in his sport and feelings of inadequacy.  He finds honesty, support, love, and safety with Rob Lovely, a rancher he meets while house-sitting in Montana.  The two men mesh well, and they teach each other that even though the outside world might not understand or respect all of their facets, they are not alone.  They complement each other's strengths, needs, and flaws in ways that felt authentic and plausible.Matty and Rob resonated with me as being deeply authentic characters.  Their motivations and reasoning are complex and valid.  The fear that Matty feels as his time in Montana draws to a close was both palpable to the reader and understandable, and Rob's concerns about balancing his desire to protect his loved ones (especially his son Ben and Matty) with his desire for them to succeed at their careers was realistic.  Both men work hard to do what they feel is best for themselves and for each other, and the occasional detour in their journeys keeps readers guessing and hoping for their happy ending.  The secondary characters, especially family and close friends of Matty and Rob, were also well-developed.The story deepened my appreciation of the dedication and sacrifices that athletes and their loved ones give to their sport.  Reading it as the Winter Olympics were wrapping up was exceptional timing!  I will gladly read this book again.  The layers to the main characters, their internal and external challenges, and their emotional and passionate connection with one another have made Matty and Rob characters that I will remember for a long time.I greatly look forward to reading more from Leta Blake, both in this series and in her other works.

Call me picky, but I found it somewhat peculiar that tool marks were left on one of the designs which really wasn't a design feature, but a cleanup issue.  Some of the projects involve no metal mixing at all.  Despite these shortcomings, the projects and information will be good for someone who wants to learn how to make jewelry on the side since these projects don't require the exacting precision found in say, wedding rings.

Relentlessly honest about what he felt in the moment with an understanding of the ironies of his life.

I had to laugh watching what&#8217;s left of The Who perform &#8220;Bell Boy&#8221; at the Hurricane Sandy benefit; Townshend here and in a recent documentary on the making of Quadrophenia made it clear he has never liked Keith Moon&#8217;s vocals on the song, that Moon takes lyrics mean to be pathetic and more than a little sad and turns them into something broadly comic, but here they were in late 2012 performing the song with a tape of Moon doing his vocals.

But even with such magical creatures, this one is for mature audiences only due to language and some very naughty scenes.The story is packed full of mystery and suspense with some hot steamy sex thrown in to spice things up. The plot was interesting and very intriguing.  The premise of the story really is good, and the characters are awesome.  There were some noticeable grammar and punctuation errors, and at times misuse of some words, however; they really did not take away from the story.

Its not the telekinesis or the transporting from realm to realm. Its not that there are Gods and Demi-Gods or mating frenzy&#8217;s or even hell hounds. Nope. How you can tell you&#8217;re reading a fantasy, is when a man tells you that he will financially support your shoe habit and he means it.

The Gods have really messed up the realms and were doing terrible things to other Immortals. So the &#8220;Creator&#8221; has charged 11 Guardians to watch over the realms while the Gods are punished and put to sleep until they&#8217;re needed again. This story is about Urian and Alexandra (Alex). These two have been eyebanging each other for centuries. Urian and his fellow Guardian and friend, Gregoire visit BDSM clubs and have sex with human females and sometimes Alex will show up and watch (Mmmm, delicious and hawt!).Alex has &#8220;visions&#8221; or &#8220;mind hops&#8221; and tries to help this woman she knows has been kidnapped and is currently being tortured. Well, then stuff start to happen and that&#8217;s all I can really say without giving anything away.This book has a good story, very dirty and delicious sex, hot hunky men with HUGE members, sexy, strong and smart women, Immortals with some mythology background and light BDSM undertones. From the prologue I was hooked. I had very clear visuals in my head on how the world/realm looked. Then right off the bat we&#8217;re treated to an awesome kinky sex scene in the club! Oh my sweet perverted little mind&#8230; it was really good. Bravo Setta Jay, Bravo!Now for some of the things that I didnt like. There is a huge cast of characters and a lot of confusing names and places. It was difficult to keep everyone straight. It would have made it a lot easier to keep track if there was a glossary of terms, names of people and places and what their job/duty/rank/race and realm is. Also I got really tired of hearing how tall all the men were. It was nice, but not necessary.Overall I flippin loved this book! The sex is super charged hot, the characters are well developed, the story line is unique and interesting and it has a little humor thrown in. I had a couple of laugh out loud moments and I love it when that happens. When Alex and Uri first get together you can almost feel the sexual need pouring out of the pages. I do need to warn you about a rape scene that some people may have a hard time with. However, the way it played out sort of left me conflicted on my feelings about it. You just have read it to understand what Im talking about because I sort of enjoyed it, but I didn&#8217;t at the same time. Uri&#8217;s fellow Guardian, Gregoire is someone I cant wait to read more about. His &#8220;member&#8221; is described to favor his equine half *waggles eyebrows* and I want to ride him like a rodeo queen. I can not wait to read his book!! Im also extremely interested in finding out what happens to Erik and Sam.",4.0

7345,"A person has to have some serious class standing to turn down the Much sought after captain'a table as beneath her.  This single is a witty and nuanced memoir of the author's stint as a guest lecturer on an exclusive ship circling the globe.  He has that dream job with few duties and paid transit.  There is plenty of my favorite rich people porn with all the details of a fabulously privileged life on the ship.  Several of his fellow travelers are fleshed out by their named characteristics, and you will remember them from every group you have joined.  He doesn't ignore the nearly slave class working on the ship to provide this pampering.  It is a two sided issue in that many of the staff earns greater wages than they could elsewhere, but the wages are still on the scandalous side.  And he also provides some great tips on getting the most out of a city in one day.  I really enjoyed the book.",5.0
7346,"First I have to admit that I am a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show which is kind of how I got into these novelizations. I was actually curious to see if the writers could really capture the characters as one comes to know them on the series and the answer is yes, reading these stories is kind of like watching a typical Buffy episode except with a little more background and depth. The writers do a great job placing these stories in the context of the series and make numerous references to events that occurred in the series. This is actually the second book of a three book series that I have now read completely and if you are a Buffy fan then I highly recommend these books, they are fast paced and again it's kind of like watching an episode! Check it out, I know you won't be disappointed!",5.0
7347,"Juliana Petersen's troubled past haunts her at every turn. The crippling memories of an abusive relationship, and the lack of support from her family, lead her to flee her old life and begin anew.After settling into a quaint college town, Juliana finally feels at peace, content to stay under the radar and keep things simple.Until Aiden Stone, her new photography professor, crashes into her life, blurring the line between love and lust. As their torrid affair reaches untold heights, Juliana struggles to keep her shuttered emotions, and growing affections, from throwing her into a relationship she isn't prepared for.With her newfound romance blinding her from the looming shadows of her past, her nightmares become reality, and she is forced to discover her true strength within.From page one, I was intrigued by this story. Rene writes in such a way that I had to know more. Aiden the sexy professor and Julia sexy student. I like the possessive male leads in a story but Julia definitely didn't find the clueless female. She had he baggage but so does Aiden.

7350,"Sigh, I had high hopes for this book, even though it was a Christian romance (admittedly not my favorite genre). In 1887 a young woman opens a safe house for former prostitutes in Denver, sounds promising right!?! Wrong, it fell just short of the mark. It took a lot of will power for me to finish this bad boy.The whole theme of &#34;all in good time&#34; is POUNDED into your skull throughout the novel. We get it! God works in His own time and you need to be patient! For example:* Dessa is eager to open up &#34;Pierson House&#34; a safe place for former prostitutes and women who want to turn their lives around. Instead of waiting for enough donations to buy a house, Dessa rushes ahead to get a loan so she can buy a house she's had her eye on. She quickly realizes that she should have waited, what if she can't make the loan payments?* Dessa rushes into an agreement with Turk Foster, a slick businessman who owns the theater (i.e. illegal gambling hall and saloon) in the bad part of town to tost a benefit for Pierson House. She realizes to late that her donors will be upset by this collaboration and will stop donating to her cause.* Dessa is quick to judge Henry Hawkins, the bank manager. She quickly writes him off as a mean ol' Scrooge who cares only for money. She and Henry are surprised when they both start to fall for each other.*Dessa offers to help two young Chinese immigrants who are going to be sold into prostitution without asking anyone for help and without thinking about the consequences. As a result there is rioting and Pierson House is at stake.Basically, Dessa is far too hopeful about everything and always gets into trouble. After a while, you just stop caring. The only characters I really enjoyed in this novel were the women and girls that stayed at Pierson House, Remee (the older haughty former prostitute), Jane (the sixteen year old that attempted to hold up a bank to get money), Nadette (a ragamuffin who keeps bringing people for Dessa to save, but won't stay herself), and the Chinese sisters Liling and Mei Mei.It's a decent story line but I was more invested in the minor characters than I was in Dessa or Henry. Not to say it was badly written, it was just a bit repetitive in the problems.For fans of historical and inspirational fiction.I received this book for free from Tyndale Press in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.",2.0

7356,"Author Dominic Hutton was so sick of being late for work that he started a blog detailing his letters to the Managing Director of train operative First Great Western. The blog became a hit as fellow commuters felt his pain as we all have to suffer unexplained delays that mess up our lives - wrong type of snow, leaves on the line and the catering water boiler failing etc. He then took the idea and has written this little beauty where he substitutes the real names for fictitious ones; but we all know it is Worst Gross Letdown (as we call it) that he is really talking about - albeit tongue in cheek.He writes to CEO Martin Harbottle and decides for every unscheduled minute he has to spend on one of the lack lustre trains he will waste an equal amount of time for Mr Harbottle. In true stiff upper lip fashion Mr Harbottle does reply but always with an eye to explaining why his train service is so crud and blaming the network operators wherever possible and acts of God - the sort of acts that have nothing to do with any deity now or yet to be conceived.In choosing material to write about Dan (the main character) shares what is going on in his life. He is recently married and a new father - his wife is having a hard time and he is working for The Globe a made up newspaper that looks strikingly like The News of the World; that is as it goes into melt down over phone hacking and other abuses. He also relates what is going on with the other commuters. But as the service deteriorates and so do the fortunes of the World's most read English `newspaper' so does Martins private life follow suit and start to unravel.This started out like a bit of a chore as it is told in a series of emails, so was a bit like being at work as I read a lot of ruddy emails. This style can and should be a tad limiting in terms of a writers ambition. It is a testament to Dominic Utton (who is a real life journalist) that he has made this eminently readable and utterly compelling. What started as a slog soon became a pleasing page turner; which I enjoyed all the more as I read it whilst commuting and knew there was a true kindred spirit out there. I ended up absolutely loving it and recommending to my fellow train sufferers. My line isn't that bad but it was still stopped a few weeks ago during the floods by what turned out to be a six inch puddle - still safety first and all that. This will give you faith in the human spirit and I can only highly recommend.",4.0

7367,"This odd and pretentious novel is based on the true case of an innocent man who falsely confessed to a series of homicides. The nation is on edge in the wake of a series of mysterious disappearances. The targets, all older, solitary sorts, vanish and their presumed abductor leaves nary a clue but for a marked playing card. Oda Sotatsu is a young man living a life both unfulfilling and uninteresting. That is until he meets a troublesome couple, the supposedly charismatic Sato Kakuzo and his girlfriend, the alluring,Jito Joo. Clearly disturbed, they play games and place wagers where the loser has to physically harm himself. They attach to Oda, inducing him into  a wager after plying him with alcohol. After losing the game, he signs a detailed confession admitting culpability in the disappearances. Joo delivers the confession to the police and Oda is soon arrested, imprisoned, abused, tried and convicted. He is subsequently sentenced to death by hanging and executed, remaining silent throughout the whole ordeal. Enter journalist Bell who is drawn to the mystery while still pondering the dissolution of his marriage. The book is largely a series of transcripts of the bewildered and dismayed family members, interrogations, newspaper coverage of the trial and finally with Joo and Kakuzo.This book felt half baked.  The transcript style of telling the story contributed to the unfinished feel. The story lacked suspense and mystery but it was far from a searing condemnation of the Japanese justice system. Obviously a confession is the gold standard in Japanese jurisprudence because there was really no evidence that a crime was committed, much less that Oda committed one. Oda's behavior and refusal to speak or defend himself was inexplicable, even if one factors in traditional concepts of honor. Joo and Kakuzo fail to trigger the fascination that classically destructive couples do. They are not Sid and Nancy, Bonnie and Clyde or even Romeo and Juliet. They are boring and shallow. The ending is a total disappointment making the sacrifice and I use the term loosely of Oda's life stupid and meaningless.This could have been an examination of false confessions or an indictment of the death penalty. It could have been a haunting character study that addressed  the relevance of honor in modern society. The spare writing contributed to a dream like atmosphere but muted even the horror of the gallows. Oda remained a cipher. Despite the cool cover, this book was no more than two hundred plus pages of self indulgence. Pass.",2.0

I was up till 1 on a work night because I didn&#8217;t want to stop reading and that&#8217;s late for me.Clementine is coming off of a few bad years that consist of a bad break up and being stalked by her professor, so she has closed herself off to pretty much everyone.  To most people she comes across as a bitch and she is ok with that as long as they leave her alone.  She doesn&#8217;t date and never wants too.

7369,"Great read. What Mills wrote about in the 1950's is amazingly relevant today. The Afterword written in 2000 by Alan Wolfe provides a noteworthy example of failing to understand that the relevance of Mill's work was not limited to the 50's and 60's. In short, Wolfe dismissed Mill's work as irrelevant at the time of his writing, and concluded that the military-industrial complex had long since been killed off by capitalism. In the short-sightedness of the pre-911 world, Wolfe's analysis would stand unchallenged. But in the post-911 world we live in today, we have been thrown back into the world Mills wrote about, as if we had never left it. Apparently not much has change. The fall of the Berlin wall and the ensuing prosperity of the post-cold war years merely moved the military-industrial complex pot to simmer on the back burner; that is until the next crisis when the &#34;warlords&#34; (Mills's term for the uniting of the military, economic and political powers to be) could once again move it back to the front burner. 911 and the war on terror were that crisis.If you want to find out why Congress seems so incredibly out of touch and useless today, read this book. If you want to find out why the policies of the uber-liberal Obama administration seem so similar to those of the neoconservative Bush administrations, read this book. If you want to find out why government bureaucracy continues to extend its reach deeper and deeper into our lives, regardless of the party in power, read this book. If you want to find out why changes of power at the election level result in such little change in policy, read this book. If you want to find out why today's liberalism seems limited to firey rhetoric and staged talking points, with both parties often using the same ones with only slight differences, read this book.All this and more is what makes &#34;The Power Elite&#34; an amazingly relevant read today.",5.0

7380,"One to Hold told the story of how Derek and Melissa found each other despite all of the obstacles that were in their way &#8211; both self created and otherwise. One to Protect continues the path to their happily ever after; a baby, a marriage, and the life Derek and Melissa have always wanted are in their grasp, but one person stands in their way &#8211; Sloan, Melissa&#8217;s ex-husband. No matter how hard Derek has fought to put Sloan away and end Melissa&#8217;s nightmare once and for all, the job can never get done because the slime ball always seems to slither away from his judgment day. But when Derek receives information that once again threatens his life with Melissa, he teams up with Patrick and an unlikely ally to end Sloan&#8217;s torment once and for all.The story is told from both Derek and Melissa&#8217;s point of views, which is the best way to tell it because as Derek&#8217;s mission to end Sloan&#8217;s control over their lives commences, Derek and Mel find themselves apart for quite a bit of the text. Readers need to understand what both of them are thinking and feeling as everything goes down, and we get that with the dual perspective.Derek is still the dominant alpha male who takes care of what&#8217;s his and every move he makes is focused on that. His love for Melissa drives him; it makes him better, and he&#8217;ll ensure that it remains that way. There is nothing weak about Melissa. She&#8217;s a fighter who had to overcome tremendous obstacles, which she did, and even though fear threatens to consume her yet again, she refuses to back down; she&#8217;ll protect Derek as much as he&#8217;s protecting her.The One to Hold Series is a fantastic journey about four dynamic characters. Even though the focus of One to Protect is on Derek and Mel&#8217;s continuing journey, Patrick and Elaine are just as important to the dynamics of the story. The way they have each other&#8217;s back is phenomenal, and the obstacles with Sloane could not have been sorted without Patrick&#8217;s quick thinking and backbone.Tia Louise&#8217;s stories are sexy, drama filled adventures that do not disappoint. They revolve around dynamic characters who hold nothing back in life and in love. The One to Hold Series is a must read for anyone who loves romance mixed with action and angst.

Then the last 35% plays out like an X-Men book so I guess this book didn't know what it wanted to be. The main character, Chapel, has up to four different love interests, maybe. Usually a book that really grabs my attention can be read in a day or two but the relationships weren't strong enough for me and people who played a big part through most of the book dropped out of sight at the end, i.e. her mother and stepfather.",3.0

7398,"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI really enjoyed this book. Escape in You is the first book that I have read by Rachel Schurig, but I will definitely be looking for more from her in the future. I thought this book was emotional and heartbreaking at times, but I really loved how Zoe and Jet were able to lean on each other. I felt bad for both of their characters, and they had been through so much. I liked seeing how they were able to grow and heal over the course of the book, and I really didn't want to put this one down.Zoe is used to using parties and alcohol to forget and escape her life. She is all about having fun for awhile and keeping things casual. When she meets Jet Taylor at a party, she thinks that he is the perfect way to spend her summer. They end up spending the party talking rather than making out, and when she leaves Jet tells her that he will see her again. Jet and Zoe end up running into each other, and before long they are seeing each other. Both are determined to keep things light, but before long they are starting to develop real feelings for each other. But with so many things in their past and in their present standing in their way, can they possibly have anything serious?I really liked Taylor (Jet). He was so thoughtful and sweet to Zoe, and he was always looking out for her. Even though he said that he just was looking for fun as well, I loved that he didn't really fight his feelings for her. He knew that things were becoming serious, and instead of running he really let himself open up to the possibility of a relationship and was honest with himself. I felt so bad that he blamed himself for things that weren't his fault. It didn't help that he had a really bad home situation that just made him feel so much worse. He really started to grow and heal with Zoe's help though, and was able to overcome so much. Zoe was also a bit broken due to things that weren't in her control. She had taken on so much responsibility for things that she never should have had to worry about. Because of her tough life, she turned to alcohol and flings with guys. I didn't agree with her choices, but I understood that she was using these things to try and escape the pain as well as cope with her bad situation. I liked how she was with Taylor though. She was always encouraging him and trying to get him to see how good he was. They were both really perfect for each other in that aspect, seeing the good in each other and supporting them while they helped each other realize that they weren't defined by their pasts. I thought that not only were they a great match emotionally, but that they also had a ton of chemistry. I loved that there was no drama when it came to their feelings for each other and that the issues they faced were outside the relationship. It was nice to see a New Adult book with no love triangle.Overall, this was a really good book. I did think that it would have been nice to see a bit more communication between Zoe and Taylor. I felt like a lot of this story was about Zoe constantly running and avoiding talking with Taylor and also with her friends. I had hoped that she would stop the push and pull a bit quicker, but that is really my only complaint. I loved that this book was a standalone with no cliffhanger, and I felt that the ending was exactly the way it should have been. This whole story played out in a way that was satisfying to the reader, and I loved watching the evolution of the characters from beginning to end. This story was interesting and captured as well as held my attention from the very start. I really look forward to reading more from Rachel Schurig in the future. I think that a lot of readers will really enjoy this book, and going on the journey with Taylor and Zoe as they grow and heal from some awful things that have been dealt their way. This story is a great example of how anyone can move forward with their life even when things seem to be hopeless or stuck.**Complimentary Copy provided by Xpresso Book Tours**",4.0

7400,"I wanted to finish this book, since there were so many possible outcomes.Unfortunately there were no surprises.It began with an intriguing introduction that was followed by a confusing cast of characters, many unanswered questions and a simplistic conclusion. Throw in some gratuitous sex and mostly unlikable characters and that's the gist of this story.",3.0
7401,"Kaye Wagner really got me hooked. They say not to judge a book by the cover, but I love the cover. From there, you&#8217;re treated to a science fiction classic, with touches of classic mystery. Mixing old and new, this genre meshing novel puts you in a three part story that is nothing short of interesting. Once you start, you will not want to put this one down. The metropolis is vivid, full of energy and this steampunk ideology, and Detective Kirin ventures through with an iconic characterization that I appreciated.Part mystery, part science fiction, and all gusto, I really enjoyed the nuances in the twists and turns that come alongside. I love the fantasy, and like the way the colorful and imaginative story unfolds through the lens of &#8220;Bladerunner&#8221;, &#8220;Escape From New York&#8221;, and even a little bit of &#8220;Omega Man&#8221;. Those are the things I thought of as I read through Wagner&#8217;s descriptions and stories. I saw that there&#8217;s more volumes, and I&#8217;m definitely going to be looking into them as well. If you&#8217;re a fan of science fiction, thrillers, and detective stories, here&#8217;s a helping of all those genres into one.",5.0
7402,"She should have stopped at two books; it didn't have to be a trilogy.The book consists of basically two things:  Katniss spending time hiding, or recovering from some mental or physical trauma, and Katniss and company in some harrowing escape.  Throughout characters die unnecessarily and horribly and the ending is depressing enough to make one sorry for having slogged through this book's horrors.I find it disturbing that the author, representing what passes for our culture's best and brightest, found it necessary to invent so much cruelty and, also, in the end, kill off one of the characters who was emblematic of why the war was fought at all.  The book's ending makes it clear that for our culture's elites, life is a constant series of wars between equally amoral titans, wherein normal people serve as nothing more than instruments for the titans' ambitions.Disturbing as well is the implication arising from the book's ending that a coal miner's offspring can never become accomplished enough to earn themselves a place among the Capitol's elites, because it makes available to them just two possibilities: try and die, or return home broken in body and spirit.  Only a character with no compunction about killing innocents can merit a move from lowly District 12 to the Capitol-connected District 2.Unless they make some serious changes to the ending in the movie, I have no desire to see the movies that will be made based on this book.",1.0

Kayce's real to life situations, her focus on the two main characters Kylah and Michael, who both want the same thing for lots of reasons, moves the story along at a nice pace. In the end, Delta makes things happen and we know that life on the Double B can only get better.  Now, I'm hooked on this new series and can't wait to read the next one.

7415,"The Enchanted simply blew me away.  Seriously, folks, since when does a book about death row completely knock someone down, because that's what happened to me with this one.  I went into it thinking there would be a whole Green Mile vibe and walked away feeling as if I'd been suckerpunched.  Not only did this book completely absorb me, it made me reconsider everything I thought I knew about pre-judging a person.The Enchanted  is part real-life and part-fairytale, but a fairytale of the darker variety.  We are introduced to a nameless narrator, a man who is in a cell waiting for his death.  He is a voracious reader and, as the story unfolds, while he doesn't reveal all of what he's done there, it gets to the point where it doesn't even matter anymore.  Who we do get to really know, though, are several other characters whose lives unfold in front of that one prisoner, in a sense.The Enchanted  is a place where strange things happen.  There is a lot of symbolism in this book and it's impossible to catch it and understand it all on the first read-through.  But it doesn't matter, because the stories being told about the lives of those in the book are enough to carry momentum until the end of the book comes - and it does come quite suddenly.I think that this is a book that would touch anyone who decided to pick it up and give it a shot.  It's unusual, but not so strange that it would put off a casual reader.  If anything, it'll make that casual reader more interested in the fate of the narrator and the other prison guards, inmates, priests, and investigators.  The Enchanted is a very profound, elegant look at a life that isn't really a life at all.  And whose fault is that?",5.0

And it is a book of love of words. A journalist always in search of a story takes up a doctorate on the subject of Mind experiments. Then she encounters a lost rare book by an obscure XIXth century author, where she discovers the formula to travel to an alternate world. And all of it is essentially one big mind experiment, the words and concepts chasing each other in an endless game of meaning, substance and illusion. Does mind equal matter? Does matter equal time? the book presents all this as mind-numbing experimentation somewhere in between Einstein's trains and the garden of Eden.",4.0
7419,"I received this book from Bookreporter.com in exchange for an unbiased review.There are some books that are so exquisitely wonderful that the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You literally can not do anything besides read it. This is one of those books. I am so hesitant to reveal too much because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. None of my words would compare to the author's but I will give a small recap.Frank Drum is a 13 year old boy in a small town in a small Minnesota town in 1961 when a summer full of death occurs. The story is told by him forty years later. I was 8 that year and the time is perfectly encapsulated. I was literally swept back to that time and my childhood. The freedom we had to roam the town all day and only come home for meals is now lost sadly. What seems as careless parenting now was a common occurrence.The tone is set by a quote by Greek playwright Aeschylus who said, &#34;He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain, which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.&#34; Frank and his 11 year old brother, Jake, learn this hard lesson as they experience death in many forms. There are deaths caused by accidents, nature, suicide and murder. And these two boys must learn to cope.As their father, a Methodist minister preaches in a memorable service after a death, &#34;The miracle is this: that you will rise in the morning and be able to see again the startling beauty of the day.&#34; The line haunts me because this book is about the miracles that occur in every day life. It leaves you with a sense of hope and joy. It is Jake who leads Frank to the discovery of every day miracles.This book has an echo of the movie &#34;Stand By Me&#34; with writing as wonderful as &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34; I expect, as others do, that it will be a classic. I know it is a book that will stay with me for a long time. As I sit here with tears streaming down my face, I know I have read one of my favorite books. I can not recommend it more highly. If you read nothing else this year, please read this one.",5.0

She is very descriptive and lays it on the line like no author I have read. Her methods are not exclusively unique, but the topics are mind altering. Whether the information she receives is 100% accurate or not, it rattles some innate knowing that can send the reader on their way to more like information. I appreciate that she is attempting to uncover some of the more elusive ancient mysteries that presently scholars have danced around. Very good book full of exciting possibilities. I would totally recommend this book to anyone!",5.0
7425,"The Brian Herbert-Kevin J. Anderson Dune books are quite polarizing. After having read the final book in this series, I find some of the criticism valid. But it's also clear that the authors did try to flesh out the Dune universe in a way that would satisfy Frank Herbert. They're clearly not quite as good with the art of writing, but the books aren't trash.As I've noted in my reviews of the other Dune House books, there is a lot of repetition and lack of subtlety in the writing. I'm not sure if this is because the book had two authors, but the book repeats itself as if worrying readers will forget. In House Corrino, I found the biggest problem to be that the book had too many disparate and sometimes interwoven plots, but little to make me care about many of them. By the middle of the book, you have dozens of characters running around starting wars, having babies, scheming, etc. The chapters are quite short, meaning that you jump around these various subplots quite a bit because every single subplot seems to climax at the same time. This happens a lot in Star Wars books and frustrates me to no end.And if you've read Dune, you know that none of it matters. Of course, this is an inherent risk with any Prequel as it's almost impossible to surprise the audience. But this is why authors who try to pen a prequel should focus on building character and depth than on plot twists. We know what has to happen, so why bother? Instead, a good prequel should tell the reader why they should care. Dune, as a single book, ironically feels like it had more depth than this book.With one exception. I did like seeing Leto Atreides becoming a leader. I thought making him an aggressive military commander was an interesting choice. The authors, as they did in the previous novels, did make him a bit too much of a goody two-shoes, but I do feel like the explanation for why he became so popular prior to the events of Dune makes sense.Ironically, despite the title, I didn't feel I'd gained much insight into House Corrino at all. Emperor Shaddam comes across as petulant and semi-retarded. This is not the same man who laid such devious plans in Dune and was so careful to hide his involvement in the downfall of House Atreides. Perhaps Shaddam grew wiser within the intervening years, but if so THAT is the story I would have wanted to read. Instead, in this book, we constantly hear Shaddam moaning about how he can make decisions without Fenring's advice (even when it's clear that he can't).Also, this book contradicts Dune in a major way. Paul is born on Kaitin, not Caladan, even though in Dune it's clear he'd never left his home world. Why? Why contradict Frank Herbert's masterpiece? Having Paul born on Kaitin added nothing to the story or his character.As this is the final book, I'm forced to ask myself if I should have read the series at all. I'd give the series as a whole 3 stars. There were some nice backstories, particularly for Gurney Halleck, Leto, and Count Fenring. But the books are just not well written. House Corrino especially feels like a triumph of breadth over depth - exactly the opposite of Frank Herbert's Dune books. I &#34;read&#34; these books as audiobooks while doing other chores, so overall I didn't exactly lose too much of my time with the books. For Dune fans, they'll perhaps give you a spice hit, but they won't inspire you to run out and get the next set of Dune books written by Herbert & Anderson.Overall: 2.5 stars.",2.0

The misunderstanding each had regarding the age of the other was very funny and I absolutely loved their friend (and matchmaker) Ginny. I really enjoy romances where the characters begin as friends and it grows into more (even if it happens quickly). There isn&#8217;t any external conflict for this couple which is nice to read sometimes, all the conflict for them is internal. Art is a widower and feels guilt moving on with his life after his wife&#8217;s death and Maddie has had some bad relationships which have left her frightened (I would have liked to see this developed a little bit more but I understand that there is only so much time to be spent in a work this short). I also liked how their faith was integrated into the story. It&#8217;s not heavy handed but realistic and something that was very relatable to me.

Due to circumstances beyond his control, William Talmudge, the story's central character, was a very damaged man. Yet he created such great beauty in his orchards, was a loyal friend to Caroline and Clee, and found love in his heart to care for two girls who had been far more damaged than he.The writing style is lovely. I did find the author's choice to not use quotation marks a tad annoying until I got used to it. But the story is mesmerizing and her descriptions of the orchard and the canyon are haunting. I admit it took me longer to read this than most books but that's because I kept re-reading passages.To me Talmudge is a genuine hero. Despite his own emotional limitations he tried to do the best for everyone in his life. He raised Angelene even though he had no reason to and he never gave up on Della even though she didn't treat him very well. To me this was a story of heroism and goodness from the most unexpected kind of hero. Well done.",5.0

7439,"Author Cindy Miles did an amazing job when she wrote &#34;Stupid Girl&#34;, the characters are exceptionally constructed and she has been able to tackle some hard hitting issues within the novel in a way that allowed you to understand their plight, sympathize and feel with them..... in effect - Stupid Girl by Cindy Miles is a definite must read!Olivia, who is our main female lead character and heroine comes from a small town in Texas. She wants to give herself a whole new life, a clean slate and a fresh start from the relationship that almost ruined her life, and with a scholarship to collage allowing her to follow her passion for astrology, she has all of the ingredients she needs to achieve it. Regardless of what happened to her she has remained down to earth but yet very intelligent with it, with her academic passion in mind she wants to keep all of her interest in the classroom rather than out of it.Meet Brax, who is our Male Lead, our hero he is what is known in surrounding circles as a &#34;Southie&#34; native, he has come to the same college also on a scholarship but for baseball. But Brax is a bit of a fighter and constantly getting himself into one situation or another! He meets Olivia on their first day of college and their connection is instant no matter how much Olivia fights it. Throughout Stupid Girl Cindy Miles writes Brax's &#34;spoken&#34; part in the Southie style, allowing us to truly feel the full extent of his character, a different style of experience, one that I must say I enjoyed.The plot of Stupid girl broached the subject of abuse in relationships and how someone can move pass what has happened to them in order for them to love again. The fact Brax, even though he is rough around the edges has such a huge heart proves that no one should judge people on what they just &#34;see&#34;, it's about the person within. The back stories to each character was very well put together and thought out, the plot did at times become predictable in places, mimicking other Novels within the NA genre BUT the Characters do set Stupid Girl a mile apart from the others - A definite recommended Novel!",4.0

7441,"This is an interesting look at the fountain of youth myth that has followed mankind since its conception. No one wants to grow old and die, and the idea of an element that can stop death in its tracks is indeed a great one. Imagine if there were a crystal that, through bathing in its light could restore your youth to you for all eternity? Now, imagine shadow creatures who are forever searching for this crystal, wishing to become human, who will stop at nothing to obtain it? Intriguing, right? It is, and I really enjoyed this aspect of the novel, though I would have loved more of the story to be devoted to these two elements. As the novel stands, we are given glimpses of these entities, but their presence is more or less felt but not seen. Hence, I am hoping that more comes of them in the second novel in the series.While I liked this novel overall, I will admit that there are a vast number of similarities between it and Twilight/New Moon, which I have to say lessoned a bit of the fun of this novel because the story itself was not necessarily unique in this aspect. The instant attraction between Emily and Theo, the underlying secret kept, Emily&#8217;s curiosity and sleuthing, the near fatal accident that puts it all in perspective for her, and the appearance of the three Guardians and their ultimatum are just a few of the many similarities that brought Meyer&#8217;s novels to the mind. In turn, this made it hard for me to really focus on Blue Moon because my mind continued to assess similarities while I read.I&#8217;ve read many books that are similar to others in this respect, but depending on the storyline and the differences, it&#8217;s either easily overlooked on my part, or impossible to ignore. I&#8217;m sorry to say that in this instance, I had a hard time ignoring the similarities and focusing on the originality, but do note that originality is indeed there. Spence adds in elements of horror, though not horror in the way that I usually think of it&#8212;there is no blood and guts strewn about&#8212;but there is a darkness that follows the story, giving it small elements of horror in a more suspenseful manner, such as the shadow creatures.I really enjoyed the introduction of the shadow creatures, the shape shifters, and the crystal itself, and I would have loved the novel to give a more intensive look at all these aspects instead of focusing so much on Emily, who is indeed a very aggravating character. But even so, Spence has created the perfect workings for her next novel should she choose to pursue the shadow creature angle.In regard to Emily, well, she is not my favorite, which is unfortunate, but understandable. Emily and I are two completely different people, and whereas she acts and defies those around her, I tend to listen to reason and observe from the sidelines. Her intense desire to know everything that is happening around her puts her into situations that I found to have been avoidable had she thought more clearly before acting, but even so, she is not me. And though I do not agree with many of her choices throughout the novel, she is still a very real representation of rash, curious people, and although I personally didn&#8217;t like her, Spence did a great job making her a valid character.Theo is perhaps my favorite of the novel. Intent on keeping Emily safe, though cryptic in his explanations, he has a good heart and will do anything for her and his family in order to keep them all safe. He, like Emily, is driven by passion more than reason, and yet it works for him&#8230; perhaps I dislike Emily so much because I am jealous?The novel is told in first person from Emily&#8217;s viewpoint, but occasionally switches to third person in a few chapters as outside elements unfold&#8212;those Emily is not privy to. It was a bit jarring at first, but as the novel progressed, I found that it worked well and that I thoroughly enjoyed this style. First person narration is in fact my favorite narration, but in order to get all the information concerning events unfolding, third person was needed, and I think that was a great choice on Spence&#8217;s part.Overall, this is a good story that looks at the depths people are willing to go to procure beauty.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.  My overall rating is that I liked it.)",4.0

7446,"I really liked this book, until the last quarter. I loved the McQuade and Rose- both apart and together. I even loved the friend, and I hope that he gets a book soon...! The storyline was well done, and most importantly the heroine wasn't annoyingly down on herself. Some people make the heroines such a doormat that you want to strangle them. It was a great story until the end when the 'evil' sister came into play about the necklace, and then the heroine did something so stiupid and so out of character that the book just colapsed on itself. Really? I thin kthat there were other literary devices that could have been used to get the heroine where she needed to be. At that point I was so dissapointed that I took it off my Kindle becasue no way was I going to read it again. I wil lgive the author another chance and see how it goes from there.....",3.0
7447,"When I ordered this book, I thought it was going to be a collection of letters between the three sisters, with perhaps a little historic commentary between each letter to put things into perspective.Instead, it's a biography, with excerpts - usually brief ones - used to flesh out and provide proof for each assertion made.Frankly I would have preferred the collection of letters, even unannotated ones.Nevertheless, I've always had a fondness for Abigail Adams, and so found the book fascinating, with new insights of her, her sisters and her husband.All of the letters quoted are listed in the notes, but alas, there is no index (at least, not in my review copy.)Anyone interested in women in history, the history of the founding of the United States, or John and Abigail Adams in general will find this thorough and detailed book of great interest.",5.0

7449,"Imagining an alternate reality with a distinct dystopian feel to it is rather frightening. In Plus One half the population live at night and the other half during the day. Curfews are set up to keep these two groups thoroughly separate. If curfew is broken, even by an underage person, the transgression is punishable. Add to this government control of your phone - tracking software included, controlled shopping, and numerous other highly inhibiting rules, and we have a very scary picture.Now imagine having a night person, or Smudge, and a day person, or Ray, in love with one another. This is the fate of Soleil and D'arcy. After reporting Sol, the main character, for a self-induced injury, D'arcy decides to aid her in her efforts to steal her niece and to protect her from the authorities. Together these two get involved in much more than the kidnapping of an infant; think dangerous medical procedures and government corruption.Sol is a realistic, well fleshed out character. Her impulsive nature combined with an ever present sense of hopelessness and negativity creates an interesting contrast, making her a particularly memorable character. These slightly offbeat, negative attributes are balanced by her open, loving nature towards her grandfather and D'arcy, and her willingness to make enormous sacrifices to see her loved ones safe and happy.For a large part of this book D'arcy is in two minds. Should he protect Sol and let the romantic side win out, or should he think of his future. The other characters in Plus One are vibrant and imaginatively crafted. From Sol's selfish brother, Ciel and the colorful, emotional Gigi to D'arcy's drama-queen mother, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne; all these characters enrich the story and made an impression on me.Filled with suspense as well as romance, Plus One is a tale of courage, sacrifice, betrayal and, ultimately, hope. This book should appeal to both YA readers as well as adults. (Ellen Fritz)",4.0

7452,"The PremiseIris Taylor moves to Austin, TX to live with her half brother Sonny, since she lost all her ties to Florida - her mother and grandmother have passed away and her other brother Will has joined the Army and is stationed in Japan.  Sonny, a member of the Widows MC, gets her a job at Pins and Needles, a tattoo shop owned by Dex Locke, a ""Dick"" of monumental proportions from the moment Iris meets him.  Iris has her secrets, and issues with getting close to people, but troubles with her loser father leads her to depending on the Widows, and she realizes that family doesn't have to be only the ones you can't choose, but the ones you can.The GoodOne of the best features of this story for me is that it isn't a cliffhanger, or a novella, but a full novel with a beginning, middle and end that takes its time to develop the relationships within.I wasn't sure what to think when I started reading this ""biker"" romance, since my experience has been hit or miss. Biker romances are usually dependent on a couple of things: the action/plot overriding actual character development and the shock factor - a world so different from your typical romance novel reader that it's like a train wreck that you can't look away from (Madeline Sheehan's Undeniable series comes to mind as one of the better examples of this).Additionally, some biker heroes land on the wrong side of alpha a-holes and I end up disliking one or both of the leads.  I am very happy to say that I really enjoyed getting to know Iris and Dex, as well as the other characters that populate this story.Dex could have been well over the line of alpha a-holes, but through first his friendship with Iris, and eventually his love, the development of his character elevates him from the one-dimensional lead he could have been.  Iris could have easily been a very frustrating heroine, yet she rides the line as well and there isn't a moment throughout that I felt played false or didn't make sense based on her history, which is revealed bit by bit.While the secondary characters aren't as fully developed as Dex and Iris, the seeds are there and I can easily see this being a series - a series I'd be eager to read.The Just OkayWhile I enjoy the fact that time is taken to develop the characters, there could have been some mild editing to tighten the story and to fix some very minor grammatical/spelling errors - though to be fair I have seen much worse, so this is a minor quibble.  The obstacle/major angst portion of the plot involving the father isn't as strong as the romance and the resolution of that plot point was almost an afterthought.The Bottom LineI was pleasantly surprised by this story and I'd recommend it for those who really like character driven instead of action-packed books.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from Ms. Zapata.",5.0
7453,"Review of: The Mark of the Dragonfly, by Jaleigh Johnson.I requested this ARC book for my fifth grader.  According to him the protagonist of the story is thirteen year old Piper, an orphan after her father died, who lives in a magical world on the edge of a meteor field in Scraptown Sixteen, which of course, is plagued by meteor strikes.  These meteorites leave huge craters which make the world very dangerous to live in.  The meteors are caused by some natural and some man-made objects.  Some of the man-made objects provide Piper with the opportunity to scavenge through and recover some technology.  Piper lives in a world filled with different kingdoms who rely on machinery, technology, and magic to survive.  Piper has an innate ability to work with, create, and repair machinery.  It also makes her want to understand where the objects originate from.  Piper discovers a wounded and unconscious Anna, part machine/part human, on the edge of the meteor field, who has a dragonfly tattoo and hails from the territory of the same name.  The caravan that Anna was riding in was destroyed by meteor strikes.  Piper, acting on the possible opportunity to be rewarded, helps Anna recover and wants to return her to her home kingdom as her tattoo and conversations lead Piper to believe that she is under the protection of wealthy King Aron of the Dragonfly Kingdom.  Using the assistance of a shape shifting boy with magical powers the trio use the 401 train to travel through the kingdoms beginning their quest to bring Anna home.  Piper, and Anna help each other survive from being chased by Doloman, the other caravan survivor, who is the chief machinist and the second-most important man in the Dragonfly kingdom.  Why is he after them?  Do they succeed?  My fifth grader classified the book as a mix of steampunk, science fiction, and high fantasy genres and found it enjoyable.  Four stars.",4.0

7459,"WOW.What an incredible collection of wickedly gruesome short crime thrillers.The collection has ten amazing tales, all different but all showcasing Simon Wood's unique writing style.Although all of the stories are good, I particularly liked the first story, 'Making Ends Meet'. The idea of killing the in-laws must surely have crossed the mind of most of us at one time or another (at least, I hope it has and it's not just me), but this serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating the consequences of such action. It really is a deliciously sinister tale with a wonderfully dark humorous twist at the end.'The Taskmasters' also stood out as an exceptional short story.It also feature 'Fender Bender'. This too is excellent, although it does appear to be a briefer version of 'The Fall Guy'. That said and done, it was enjoyable to read this shorter version of the tale.All in all, this is one of the best collections of short crime stories that I have ever read and definitely one that I would recommend to all fans of crime thrillers.",5.0

7464,"Review of Driven and Fueled togetherOH MY GOSH!! Where do I even start with these two books? I have read many books and let me say I can count on one hand the books that I have been in awe with and that have left me with  that oh my god I need more feeling, and these books will definitely join that list. To say I LOVED these books would be an understatement! Right from the beginning of Driven you will be sucked in and in love with Colton, I absolutely couldn&#8217;t get enough of that man and his sarcastic little mouth! Riley is a very hard working,  strong,  independent woman who is just disgusted with Colton and his full of himself attitude when they meet but even though she loathes him she is very drawn to him. The chemistry between the two of them is off the charts they can&#8217;t stay away from one another the only problem is Colton doesn&#8217;t do the relationship thing and Riley&#8230; well she is a good girl and doesn&#8217;t do the one night stand thing. So what should they do?The second book in this series is Fueled and let me tell you ladies after you read Driven you will be like oh my god but then when you read Fueled you will be like what the hell NO!! Sometimes in a series the second book isn&#8217;t as good as the first one however with these two the second book was absolutely as good if not better than the first and as I say this I don&#8217;t mean to take anything away from the first book at all because trust me the first book is fricking awesome but Fueled is amazing!If you have these two books currently sitting on your device or bookshelf and just haven&#8217;t gotten around to reading them, READ THEM NOW! I let them sit on my kindle for a while before I read them and I totally regret it! These were the best books I have read in a while by far and I can&#8217;t wait for Crashed  (that is the third one due in March) to come out.

7467,"A really great Kindle read.  Non-intellectual that I am, I assumed the original BBC series was a pure TV plot.  Only when the American version showed up did I learn that Michael Dobbs was not only a real life person, but also an honest to goodness inner member of the Thatcher government.The BBC series was an almost page for page retelling of the three books so, if you have seen the series, there are not to many surprises in the book.  Despite that, the sheer beauty of the text makes it a page turner.  The only true difference is that in the BBC version, after each piece of villainy, Ian Richardson would turn sweetly to the camera and in that great oily voice calmly explain exactly what he did and why.  These lectures are missing from the book.  All is not lost, however.  Each chapter starts with a pure political reality quote, presumably by Francis,  that takes your breath away.""Politics comes from the Greek word ""Politico"" which means the mass of people.  A Tick is a small bloodsucking creature.""""The Bible says many times you must forgive your enemies.  Nowhere does it ever mention that you must forgive your friends.""A true bummer, however, is that only the first book of the trilogy is available on kindle.  This might be explained by the author's notes that this version of ""House of Cards"" is a new edition that has been largely rewritten and reissued in conjunction with the American Netflix version.  All was not lost.  After a search I was able to find the two remaining parts as used books from Amazon.As an aside, if you have not started into the Kevin Spacey remake on Netflix, I would recommend you start with the BBC original, also available from Netflix.  Kevin Spacey is good in his quest for power, but Ian Richardson was incredible.  You think Walter White is a villain whom you have cheer?

7469,I picked up Ramona Ausubel's collection of short stories after seeing the book appear on the NY Times 2013 Notable Books list.  I had heard that this collection of short stories was different than most but WOW it certainly is.  There are stories here that don't just border on but really are beyond reality.  &#34;Chest of Drawers&#34; was probably the craziest as a husband whose wife is expecting starts to grow a chest of drawers in his own chest.  In a similar story &#34;Tributaries&#34; people begin growing extra arms and hands which come in useful day to day albeit being a bit awkward.  One story that I enjoyed a lot talks about a man with two children who rigs up a contraption to drop &#34;snow&#34; on people as they walk by in California thereby making it feel like Christmas.  The stories are all written in a very tight manner. None of them feel as if you are having to wade through the mud while reading them although in a few the cringe factor is quite high.  I highly recommend the book and think you will enjoy it a great deal. A definite departure from the standard collection of stories..,4.0

7471,"November moves from NYC to Tennessee after surviving a mugging.  And that's about as interesting as this story gets. Any sort of conflict or excitement in the book is quickly glossed over and goes no where.This book should have only taken a day or two to read. Instead, three painful weeks later, I've finally finished.This author- I mean main character has major daddy issues. The father tricks her into working the books at his strip club and she immediately rationalizes it by saying he's the smartest, bestest man alive so those strippers are super lucky to work for him. Ummmm... Overall that relationship gave me the skeeves.You know why the main dude mistook you for your father's stripper girlfriend? Because your relationship is weird and gross.The story is told in very short, yet over detailed sentences that insert the authors personal traits to come off as a quirky, unique butterfly but it reads as fan fiction to herself.November loves dresses. November took sewing classes to make her own dresses. She wears a dress every day. Dresses can be accessorized with a jacket or earrings. November loves wearing them with flip flops. Ok, and?November took a shower. She forgot her conditioner in the car. November scolded herself for leaving her conditioner in the car.And on and on it goes, whether it's about November's love for coffee, November pumping gas, November and her favorite blue jeans that are so dark they're almost black but they're definitely not black so don't mistake them for black.She listens to rap music! She wants to go mudding!

7473,"When I read the reviews for The Last Days of California, I expected a coming-of-age story, but to reduce this clever, sometimes dark and often tender novel to a 'coming-of-age' story, is to do it a disservice. In Jess and her apocalypse-hungry parents and just-pregnant prettier sister Elise, Mary Miller slyly reminds us of the keen appetites and yearnings we all share -- for love, for adulation, for the whole array of American fast food, for money, for sex, for salvation, and even for damnation.  On their road trip from Montgomery to destinations west, in what their father is convinced are the last days before the rapture, Jess and Elise travel their own backseat journey. But their compass points toward adventure, not the end times. Yes, there are comic and sexual episodes. And yes, there are mishaps, flat tires, swindles, a flea market, a casino--and death--along the way.But the plot is only one pleasure. Seeing life via Jess holds as many satisfactions. Because they're in high school, Jess and Elise waver between youth and adulthood. They share a hotel bed like small children, where Jess notes, Elise was &#34;so close that she could only look into one of my eyes at a time.&#34; Jess is a fond younger sister, who doesn't want to go to heaven if Elise won't be there -- she'd rather chance a post-Armageddon earth overrun with criminals intent on stealing their food and guns. Jess ruminates that Elise, &#34;was the only skinny one, and I was glad for it because I didn't want our whole family to be overweight--it would seem like a fundamental flaw, like something we'd never overcome.&#34; Under a bleach-scented motel sheet she recalls a tv show about pests. &#34;The family with bedbugs had closed them up in a suitcase and carried them home from a motel just like this one. The bugs were hard and adapted to survive, moving up and down the stairs on the children's stuffed animals.&#34; And she's a casual but cunning observer. Of her parents: &#34;My mother put a hand on the back of his neck and told him he was doing a good job, which she did when he was doing a bad job.&#34; And of her mother: &#34;She seemed like a nice person, doing all the nice things nice people did....but when one of her best friends died, she hadn't even seemed sad about it.&#34;The real destination in this utterly satisfying story is nowhere near California&#8212;it&#8217;s an interior journey, and you'll be richly rewarded if you ride there with Jess.",5.0

7477,"THIS DARK ROAD TO MERCYBy Wiley CashStoking a fire that was uniquely lit by such a great first novel A LAND MORE KIND THAN HOME would be a daunting task for any new author.  Wiley Cash has been struck by lightning again with his second southern gothic tale.THIS DARK ROAD TO MERCY is almost close to perfection.  Narrated in three voices, it is the story of the plight of 12 year old Easter and her younger sister Ruby orphaned after they find their mother dead of an overdose.  Fleeting memories of their daddy Wade playing for a minor league baseball team is all they have to comfort themselves.  Now residing at a pseudo orphanage they await possibly to be adopted by grandparents they have never met.One day out of nowhere Wade reappears and convinces them to disappear with him.  Following them is a man of distinction with an agenda of his own. With a passion for vengeance completely deeply rooted in a past that both men share.When Easter is telling her story one cannot notice how truly perfect her verbiage is as a twelve year old girl.  One honestly believes every line, every description, every experience is witnessed through the eyes of a twelve year old.  Most authors have not been able to master that ability.Layered with the flavor of the deep south and dark and brooding as this thriller intensifies THIS DARK ROAD TO MERCY by Wiley Cash is a great read and worthy of the ranks of a great southern novel.Jim Munchel",5.0

7491,"The Wildlife-Friendly Vegetable Gardener was a fun, easy read with many organic gardening tips and suggestions offering a variety of ways to live in harmony with the environment plus plenty of cute, whimsical illustrations. The author uses her years of gardening experience on her small farm, a certified wildlife and botanical sanctuary in Colorado, as a basis for the book.The author begins by urging the gardener to observe and understand the wildlife that visit the garden, to rethink our relationship with nature. Not every bug is harmful, not every bird is destroying the crops. By observing we learn which are good and how to identify them. Those green caterpillars on your parsley? They won&#8217;t eat a lot and in a few weeks will be on their way to becoming the beautiful Swallowtail Butterfly. In my own garden I plant a few extra parsley plants especially for them and when I find a caterpillar, I move it to their plant.Becoming wildlife-friendly is not something that will happen overnight. Following the approach in this book requires patience and time to watch, wait, and learn. Take ten minutes here and ten minutes there to see what is happening around you. The author recommends keeping a journal, observe your yard, take photos &#8211; it&#8217;s time well spent in learning about your own garden.Many of the techniques mentioned in the book are probably already known to seasoned gardeners. I&#8217;ve been gardening for many years and yes, some of these have worked well for me, others were new ideas. Plant parsley around my lettuce to deter rabbits? They&#8217;ll eat the parsley instead? I&#8217;ll have to try it but if the bunnies bring their friends, the wire fence goes back up!Although I wouldn&#8217;t call this a reference book or how-to manual, it does contain a few quick reference charts and garden design suggestions. The book reads like a conversation with the author as she takes you on a journey through her garden.

7495,"A good chronicling of Virginia Mason's journey to lean. It illustrates the long and involved history of initial inspiration, learning and the trials and tribulations of converting processes and organizational culture. For those thinking this is an easy course to take, or that it is simply the latest in corporate fads, the case of Virginia Mason will show them otherwise.The shortcomings of the book, to me anyway, is that it is mostly about the challenge and achievements of organizational change. It was fairly light on what aspects of lean/six sigma worked. I would have liked to read more about specific tools (e.g., VSM, 5 S, heijunka, kanban) and their use. Where were they successful, where did it take several tries, how can we readers learn from your experience. These are mentioned here and there, but insufficiently to help the rest of us in our own journeys.It is a useful tool for upper management. They may not be interested in the getting into the weeds. but they are interested in the time and devotion it took to change the organization.",4.0

7504,"I really enjoyed the premise of this book. When I stumbled across it, I was really excited to find a different kind of read.  It seems so many ya romance right now follow much the same formula only the names have changed (to protect the innocent ha!). And it was wonderfully different in setting and plot. It was very emotional and I could feel the characters pain. There were many good points. As I said, the plot was exciting and well thought out. The writing had a good flow. The chemistry between the h/h was out of this world. What truly wrecked it for me was that it did follow one very common formula in so many books I've read lately. The hero was so irrevocably in love with the heroine, that in the time it took to work their relationship out he slept with girl after girl. He was in so so much pain in his true love for her he had a terrible time keeping himself out of bed with any girl available! He even takes one home right in front of our girl! Yes, they were not technically &#34;together&#34; so you can't label him a cheater, but I'm really tired of reading this plot line. Oh, right - but they meant nothing to him! He loved - loved I say, our girl! Please authors, hear me NOW! This is not attractive. Yes, we want to have the hero proven to us to be sexy and irresistible but can someone please write me a book bf that has just a bit of honor? Do men really do this? As women, when we are in love - we don't want anyone else. All the men I have been blessed to know in my life that had some small amount honor seemed to feel the same way. So please, please stop this trend ! You ruined an absolute 4 to 4.5 star read for me.",3.0
7505,"This book, which takes place between Blake Crouch's first and second books, deals with teenagers who are old enough to have strong memories of the world before coming to town and therefore have dreams of leaving without knowing why they can't - unlike the adults who are staying for their children and the young kids who do not remember another world. The main character, Carrie, is particularly interested in seeing what's beyond town, and Sheriff Burke has to keep her from the truth.

The main heroine is boring and flip floppy in every other paragraph.  It read like this.... blah blah blah..... no I changed I mind.... blah blah blah... no I changed my mind again.  Same crap in EVERY chapter.  Don't waste your time.  Try any other of her books than this one.,1.0
7508,"One of my favorite things about this book is that it's actually set during the school year. So many YA novels are summertime-themed (*cough*guilty*cough*) so it's refreshing to see one that actually deals with school, classes, and other aspects of a teenager's life. The MC, Wren, sets out on a mission to win the lead role in the school play, with nerves and ambitions like any other teenage girl, but on the side, her real passion is interior design/decorating. One of the coolest things about Wren is her liking for/talent in woodshop class. It's so opposite of everything girly, but it works for her, and it really plays into the depth of her character.Wren it put to the test after her aunt, the school's play director, quits - and she has to take over the school play. I don't want to spoil the book, but I loved the interactions between Wren and Derek. Their dynamic - within the realm of the play and outside of it - was great, and I loved how she tried to place her own feelings about him rather than assuming his reputation was legit. They weren't without conflict, but the ending of this book was incredibly sweet. If I had to find a word to describe this book, I'd go with &#34;cute&#34; because it's just adorable and fun and everything that contemporary YA novels should be. Wren's personal growth and accomplishments over the course of the novel along with well-rounded characters makes this a great read for YA fans of all ages!",5.0

7512,"A copy of this book was provided by the author via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This review is courtesy of The Storybook KingdomThe second I read the X-Men comparison I was sold. You add in a murder mystery, and I am more than sold. Fortunetely this book delivered and I devoured it in less than a day.Tessa isn&#8217;t your normal 16 year old girl, she&#8217;s a Varient. She&#8217;s able to mimic the appearance of anyone she touches. Working for a secret government division Tessa is sent on her first mission. She&#8217;s to take on the life of the latest victim of a serial killer to find out their identity. Her mission turns out to more than she&#8217;s ready for as Tessa deals with secrets, lies, and being a teenage girl seeing what it&#8217;s like to be normal for the first time in her life.I loved everything about this book. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and held on to it until the very end. Tessa was incredibly easy to relate to even though she was dealing with not so everyday problems. She also had to deal with normal teenage feelings and problems along with the problems that came with being a Varient. Tessa, although unsure of herself, proves to be a braver and stronger as the book goes on. She&#8217;s determined to prove herself to prove herself and as agent and to not let anyone down. All of this just made Tessa even more likeable.The murder mystery held it&#8217;s own within the book. There were lots of twists and turns, and when I was positive I knew who the real killer was, I was entirely surprised. I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me figure out what the killer&#8217;s motive was until it was all revealed. I&#8217;m usually good at this stuff. I was a lot of crime dramas. The reveal was exciting,and I wasn&#8217;t sure how it was all going to turn out.As for Alec and his relationship with Tessa, I&#8217;m a bit on the fence about it. I feel like I didn&#8217;t get to know enough about Alec to really get a feel for him and his feelings for Tessa. I&#8217;m also confused about some of his actions toward her. Hopefully this will be resolved in the next book. Either way, I loved Tessa and the story enough to overlook it.If you&#8217;re looking for a combinations of X-Men, Veronica Mars, and maybe a bit of Criminal Minds then this is definitely the book for you. It so happens that I love all of those so this was definitely a book I loved. I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens to Tessa in the next book.",5.0

With passion, action, fight and intrigue it's a busy book, but is paced well and flows perfectly. When Shane wakes up in a hospital bed with amnesia, the wife he left broken-hearted isn't quite so forgiving. Josie may be trying to forget their past, but he is hell-bent on remembering...Shane and Josie have a superb chemistry filled with passion, intimacy, suspense and surprises. Their journey is truly a captivating read and is touching and heartfelt with moments that make you smile.

7519,"I say forgettable because, while reading this novel, I had faint recollections of virtually every passage, telling me I had read the story at some earlier period.  So, it's not a bad novel, it's just...forgettable.I do like the Windham family and I thoughtWorth Lord Of Reckoning (Lonely Lords Book 11)was a beautiful, beautiful story.  Also, the two stories of the duke and duchess.  I was all set to be crazy about this one, too.The family dynamics were entertaining and carried the story for me.  The story itself was okay, but plodding.  Anna's Big Secret made her look like a fool or a wimp; I can't decide.Note to author:  The incessant references to ""cold lemonade,"" ""iced...,"" were, no doubt, written to impress upon me, the ignorant reader, that this was a wealthy household.  Yes, yes, even I am aware of, ""...The rich have ice in the summertime...""  You might consider that sometimes a whisper can be louder than a roar.  I rather resent being insulted by an author.Those who abhor anachronisms (coffee table...really?) may not enjoy this tale.  You must also be prepared for gallons of lemonade with LOTS of sugar (wealthy, you know,) and marzipan by the ton.  I waded through these obstacles in hopes of reading the same lyrical prose with which WORTH was written.  Alas, not to be.Fortunately, the author only descended into the *F* word a couple of times.  Neither scene was essential to the story, so I skimmed/skipped.  But why does GB, with her command of the language, feel compelled to swim in the gutter?At the end of the day, all that saw me through to the end were the accounts and dialogues of the family members.

The story was complicated as far as what the characters faced while still believable. I just found the book troubling overall.

7529,"I've become enamored of jelly rolls, recently. It means one less step in piecing quilts, speeding up the process; and it ensures that at least ONE part of the cutting-fabric-out process has been accurately done. But using the packages of 40 2.5&#34;-wide strips requires a specific design sense, and I've found the books by Pam and Nicky Lintott to be reliable guides. (Note that Amazon now carries some jelly roll fabrics, in case you're a long way from a quilt store.)This book has a fun premise, at least for those of us who want to make smaller quilts (e.g. small enough to comfortably quilt on a home sewing machine). You take one jelly roll, split it into two batches of 20 strips, add background fabric, and make two not-quite-related quilts. For example, the &#34;Playmates&#34; pattern creates a quilt that's 43&#34;x58&#34;, using 20 strips, 1.5 yards of fabric for sashing and border, and 16&#34; of fabric for binding. Its companion &#34;Fairy Steps&#34; is 47&#34;x54&#34; and uses 1.5 yards for sashing, borders, and binding.While the 18 designs in this book are essentially interchangeable (that is, all use 20 strips, not 17-and-23 or whatnot, which would leave you a few short), by making these in sets you can see the different moods created from the same jelly roll. For example, &#34;Spinning Tops&#34; and &#34;Train Tracks&#34; both use a jelly roll called &#34;Spring Fever;&#34; the &#34;Snapdragon&#34; and &#34;Fairy Steps&#34; designs are shown using a Moda jelly roll called &#34;Three Sisters Martinique.&#34; If nothing else, it helps me improve my &#34;Hmm, what would I do with that?&#34; design sense. (Even though some of the fabrics are not quite my own taste.)So far, I made one quilt, the aforementioned Snapdragon (with nine-patch blocks and snowball blocks). It has turned into a LOVELY baby quilt, at 38&#34;x50&#34; (or less; I decided against the outer border); I'd post a photo but the baby's mom hasn't seen it yet and we must keep SOMETHING a surprise. As it turned out, the roll I picked up at my local quilt shop was only half a jelly roll, so things actually worked out for the best. (Now I have no guilt about needing to do something with the other half a of a jelly roll.)If you have any experience quilting, the instructions are reassuringly easy to follow. (I would not choose this as my first quilting project, despite the relative ease of piecing, as the authors do take some knowledge for granted; but it'd be good for a third or fourth project.) The quilt top went together easily, in a happily puttery weekend project sort of way.The one disappointment with the Lintott's books is in the actual quilting. They do everything on a long-arm in an all-over design, and offer no suggestions on how to quilt the quilt. Among the reasons I'm so pleased with my Snapdragon is that I did a lot more quilting, beyond the basics (with a motif in the middle of each snowball block). I wish they offered more suggestions on the quilting side of things.Still, I'm glad I bought this book. I'm sure to make more quilts from it!",5.0

This book showed up on my recomended list from Amazon.  I read the brief write up and it sounded like something that I would enjoy. So I took the chance and purchased it.The books starts out well enough.  It's first half is very reminicent of some of the Steve Alten &#34;Meg&#34; novels.

In that cave system lies an acient sea that has been completely separated and protected from the outside world.  And in this secret sea, we find another secret.....Predator X.The main character of the book is Megan.  The story is told from her perspective.  She is some sort of geologist and when the first team of explorers to the hidden sea turns up missing she jumps at the chance to join the rescue team.This book is great for two reasons.  First, Megan's character is so believable - both in her actions and in her dialog - that the story reads like a first person account of something that actually happened.  It gives the story a very &#34;real&#34; feel to it.  Second, about halfway through the book, the plot thickens......and then thickens some more.....and then more again.  What starts off as an unsuspecting fish story, blows up into a full-on science fiction romp.  By the time you get to the end of the book, you've completely given up on trying to guess what's happening next.  The ending is refreshing because it's not where you expect Waller to go with it.My only slight knock on the book is its title.  The story is so much larger than the surviving Pliosaur at the bottom of the prehistoric sea.  Maybe that was intentional on Waller's part so as not to give away the major plot twists hidden later in the book....but I can't help but feel that there is a better title out there for this one.  Regardless, this book is fun and absolutely worth the read for anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story.  I will absolutely read C.J. Waller again.  Very nicely done.",5.0
7558,"This was a good book. It was a little wordy for my liking, but good anyway. I enjoyed the plot and the characters. I enjoyed the friendship of the guys from 5th street gym. The many times they mentioned Bianac's big Brown eyes was a little to much. But the romance was good and the story overall was good.",3.0
7559,"The paranormal book is about Faes (empaths) and Lycans.  Ms. Charles has created a society of shifters who have their own government to help them exist in the human world in safety.  The pack mentality and laws are interesting and help shape the characters.  She makes you care about the heroes and loath the villains.  I must admit I am pretty good at figuring out a mystery.  I knew there was more going on but did not have it figured out correctly.  I loved that!  The love story between Eve and Rafe is good, conflict stated and then Damian is thrown in there to add a little dash of a love triangle.Nice to revisit some old friends from previous books.  Looking forward to last two books.  As stated in other reviews the books are free except the last one Road to Redemption, which is a continuation of Damian's story, for on 2.99.  Well worth the price.  Can't wait to read it.  He has a way of creeping into your heart. Would have paid for all after reading the first one.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes paranormal/werewolf genre.",5.0

7561,"This was a really good book from a first time author. I really liked the flow of the book from &#34;lust at first sight&#34; to misunderstandings to growing up and finally to being with the one you love. There weren't much magic in this book so the title can be misleading but it's basically a story about a girl finding what she wants in life after a few bad dates and ends up with the one she should be with.Some parts were funny, some parts were sweet, and most parts I wanted to shout at the main character (Abby) to stop being so timid and say something to the guy she really loves.There were some parts of the book I glossed over as the details weren't that important to what I was reading, but I suppose the author put them in there to show the reader how Abby was growing up, learning, and owning up to it.So if you want a light yet detailed book about love, friendship, and growing up, I think you'll enjoy this book too.",4.0
7562,"For the most part The Masked Heart follows the Regency romance formula: dashing, but jaded hero plus beautiful girl with a secret multiplied by familial obligations and complications = convoluted action leading to the inevitable HEA.  The exception in TMH is the unusual career choice of the heroine, Blaine, to become an actress to support her family.  Admittedly, I raised my eyebrow when reading this as acting would likely have been the next to last choice of a lady of quality in the Regency era.  To her credit the author, through Blaine's own ruminating, acknowledges this and still manages to make this plot device work.  Because of this I almost gave this story a 4 star rating.What earned it three instead of four stars is the authors tendency to have sticky and potentially dangerous situations work out too neatly and too easily with no attendant consequences.  I would have liked a little more tension.  I also felt that the author's choice of names for her central characters, Blaine and Drew, seemed a little too modern.  I realize that this may be a picky criticism, but I had that thought several times as I was reading.  All-in-all, it's not a bad read, it's just not a great read.",3.0

7564,"Unlike the Griffin translation this edition, which is from the late 19th century, intermixes the text and the commentary.  In a way that's good because it's easier to associate the text to the commentary, but sometimes the commentary isn't all that good or insightful.",4.0
7565,"As a fan of the sci-fi genre I'm impressed by the author's worldbuilding and the unique premise seen in this story.  From the vividly depicted variety of alien species to the advanced scientific technology it was easy to become immersed in this story.  As the first book in a series it laid some compelling groundwork for future stories that leave me excited for what's to come.Along with the intriguing and eye-catching scientific background there's a compelling and steamy romance between two very different people, people whose existence is frowned upon but have found a purpose in the military.  After the bloody end to her previous placement in a squad, the truth about Yoland was discovered and the importance of her ethnicity and the hormones she secretes leads to her being blackmailed.  She's chosen to be in a new squad that knows of how her previous assignment ended with each member going out of their way to ignore the potent pheromones she gives off, almost treating her delicately and brotherly.  Yoland is scared of the potency of the pheromones she gives off and dreads being touched because of the loss of control that overtakes her body.  It's hard to know what's real when her body so easily betrays her.  She can be seen as a strong-willed woman in most cases but when it comes to her genetics things are beyond her control and I ached for her in those situations.  Everyone wanted to take advantage of her hormones, from the scientists who wanted to collect her pheromones to combat disease to those men who tried to violate her.  Through it all, she had to keep the truth of her heritage hidden as it's illegal and places her family in jeopardy and lead her to doing whatever necessary to keep them safe.Dog is an intimidating man with his larger than life looks.  Behind these looks hides a man full of loyalty, a protector of the weak and downtrodden, someone honorable yet able to admit that when he sees something he wants he goes after it.  Yoland is exactly what he wants the moment he sees her and he unleashes a sensual onslaught to claim her.  He's a powerful man used to taking control and Yoland becomes his perfect match as his Alpha hormones call to her Prime ones.  At no time does he take her against her will as he's sworn to keep her safe and his honor won't let him sway.Theirs is a relationship full of twists and turns, as is the storyline and who's on the side of good and who has nefarious deeds in mind.  The romance is hot and nicely incorporated into the action that sometimes dragged though, especially early on.  There's a lot of characters introduced throughout the story that sometimes caused confusion, though some were immensely appealing and leave me wanting to see more of them.  Ultimately this was a satisfying story vividly depicting the best of what sci-fi can be.  The storyline was compelling and though there's completion at the end there's still room for more storytelling and I'm greatly anticipating what the future brings!",4.0

I don't feel engaged by the characters and the writing seems very bland.  I am not going to give up on the book.

7571,"Starting just over three years ago I spent two of those years losing 90 pounds.  I KNEW diets didn't work for me so I lost the weight by eating like a person of 'normal' weight.  I did however.....watch portion size.  I lost the weight pretty slow and did get an exercise bike which I've been on six days out of seven (min. 45 minutes).Six years ago I developed Grave's Disease which resulted in the loss of my thyroid.  Because of the loss of my thyroid I'm on synthetic thyroid - for the rest of my life.  Thyroid hormone controls metabolism and once I get stressed.....my metabolism goes off kilter.  This is where I've been for the past six months and I've regained 20 of my 90 pounds.  Last week I had the 'usual' blood test for thyroid level (TSH).  I'm on the low end but it's still acceptable to the medical community - regardless of how I feel (fatigued, little energy, and I don't want to do a thing!).  My level being low means I'm running a bit hyperactive - but OFF.....is OFF.  I feel crummy.  I'm also COLD - much of the day.Anyway......I'm desperate to get back to where I was and this book gives me hope but I'm just not sure how to execute a plan.  I don't want to go crazy with food but in fact keep myself to the plan of eating like a person of 'normal' weight.  For the past six months this has resulted in a weight gain (damn thyroid!).  When I see my Endocrinologist this May (they cannot see me before then - too booked-up) I'm planning to ask if I can change over to a natural thyroid medication - and get away from synthetic - hopefully.  I know the doctor won't like this but I've read enough about this subject and hope to give him a good argument on the matter.I've taken my waking temperature for a week and it averaged 96.8 - never over 97.  I'm going to take some of what this book professes and hope it warms me up AND helps my metabolism (which is sluggish at best and controlled by synthetic hormones).  As far as the stress factor?  I'm working on that and know in time, it'll resolve by itself.  Therefore; I must work on handling the stress better.Thank you Matt Stone.  You've put some fresh new ideas on the table.......and I'm ready for radical because 'scientific' approaches have never worked for me and I've spent a life-time with weight issues before being diagnosed with Grave's Disease.  I'm sick of the battle.  I very much appreciate your style of writing which I find quite compelling and snarky.",5.0

7573,"So, I was in the mood to read something different, and I&#8217;ve have this book sitting on my Kindle for a while.  After thinking, &#8220;how much more different can you get than a post-apocalyptic octopus shifter story?&#8221; I said WTH&#8230;I&#8217;ve only heard good things, I&#8217;ll give it a shot.  I&#8217;ll admit, I didn&#8217;t know if the whole octopus thing would work for me, or if I&#8217;d just be weirded out by it, but&#8230;HOLY CRAP!  I am in love with everything about this story!We have Teagan Moss, who is a human ambassador, as well as a kick-@$$ female, and in no way your typical damsel in distress.  Someone has taken her, strapped a bomb to her, and thrown her into the ocean, and that really pisses her off.  Thankfully, Ariston Dago (a Dagonite sentry) isn&#8217;t too far away, and is able to save her before she is swallowed up by the creepy creatures down below.There is an immediate connection between the two that neither can explain.  Ari doesn&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s feeling the way he is towards the human, but he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.  Teagan tries to fight her feelings and focus on who tried to kill her and why, but those feelings soon prove to be too much to ignore.  Maybe just one round and she&#8217;ll have him out of her system?  Not with those talented tentacles, to say the least&#8230;I love the world the author created for us, and while everything was very different and there was a lot of new world to explore, she made it very easy to keep up with everything.  Eternal Echoes is a very action-packed, fast-paced story of love, destiny, politics, change, and a male and female lead that both kick @$$ and take names.

7578,"I liked this well written story, the first one I've read by this author. There are some minor problems with editing - a few missing words, wrong pronouns, etc..., but nothing that seriously detracts from the story. The lead characters are interesting, complex, well rounded people with the supporting characters contributing to the richness of the plot and the main character's lives as fully fleshed friends and family.The banter and chemistry between Sam and Mel is well written, as is the sarcasm. The love that Sam has for his uncle Tommy and vise versa is also well done-the two tough guys trying not to get too mushy. I absolutely loved Sam the ladies man's horror at being groped on the street by strange women in response to his ""Mr Right"" ads, and also Mel's barely concealed jealousy at the women who were doing the groping. I also loved the descriptions of Mel's dog and his pouting at being insulted. The best thing was the HEA, for more than one romance.There are sexual scenes but they're not overly drawn out or graphic, there isn't any violence and I don't recall any profanity.Heat factor moderate.",4.0

7584,"Sophmore Campaign by Frank Nappi took me completely by surprise.  I am not a baseball fan by any means but I was able to relate to the story in many ways.  Being born in Wisconsin and having parents who talked about Robin Yount and Paul Molitor, I was thrilled to discover that the novel focused on the Milwaukee Brewers.  This in and of itself drew me into the story despite its baseball focus.  I was thrilled as I read more and realized that one of the main character Mickey Tussler was exhibiting symptoms of autism. With a background in Special Education and a lot of experience working with Autistic children and adults, I genuinely enjoy working with and learning about individuals on the Autism Spectrum.  Two points of connection already had me won over, but as a read further and I saw the story take on the topic of segregation during the 1940&#8217;s and the struggle to concur it I knew that the book would be outstanding.I enjoyed this story so much that I read it in less than a day.

7598,"I don't know but I gave up on King's novels by the late 1990's after being a true and loyal fan.  They gradually began to lack the same bone chilling suspense and nail biting horror that his past novels had. ( I guess his rehabilitation from alcoholism had a lot to do with it.  The novel even seemed to be an outlet for King to describe this part of his life.)  When I discovered he wrote a sequel to The Shining (one of the scariest books I read by him) I just could not resist the temptation to read it.  At first I was intrigued and enjoyed the first hundred pages but by the time I was well into the book I was beginning to pray that it would get better.  The climax just never peaked but fell flat and boring.  I was expecting the character of Rose the Hat to at least have the upper hand against Abra and Dan to add the usual anxiety and tension that King puts in his novels.

This is going to be a adventure of bad luck charms and devil-worshipping and Lily is going to need all her wits and friends!I don't read a lot of paranormal mysteries. I have a couple of series that I am completely devoted to and the Witchcraft Mysteries by Juliet Blackwell is one of them. I fell in love with this series when I listened to the first two books (Secondhand Spirits and A Cast Off Coven) on audio, with Xe Sands narrating. This is the first book in the series I've read in paperback form, rather than audiobook form, and I can confirm whatever format you choose this series is fantastic!I like Lily because she is very real. Yes, she's a fictional character, but Juliet Blackwell writes her so well, with flaws and talents, that I imagine she'd be someone I would encounter at my local vintage clothing store. Lily has had a very interesting childhood and alike to a onion, she has lots of layers and slowly we are starting to unravel the layers. In Hexes and Hemlines we learn more about Lily, her teacher, Aiden, the most powerful witch in Sans Francisco, Sailor, his psychic minion, and even Oscar, her familiar, who takes the form of a pot-bellied pig but is a goblin.The mystery is not just another murder for Lily to solve, but she learns more about the dynamics about Aiden and the witches and paranormals of Sans Francisco. I feel like there is still a lot more for us to discover about these characters and I can't wait to dig into the next book in the series.If you enjoy paranormal cozy mysteries with memorable characters then I highly recommend picking up Secondhand Spirits and making your way through this series.

He covers the social and system failures that led to the catastrophic dam break and flood, but doesn't get carried away by trying to rewrite history, or play into stereotypes and social trends by casting blame on a small set of individuals. He examines in detail the various human errors, lack of foresight, and unfortunate changes in weather that led up to the dam break and washed away three towns in a day. More people died in Johnstown than died on the Titanic, and through a similar sequence of bad luck and bad decisions that make us shake our heads in hindsight and ask, ""Why?"" ""How?"" It was the perfect storm, and yet no-one remembers Johnstown as they do the Titanic. It should be remembered. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical non-fiction.",5.0

I found myself laughing a lot, seriously smiling and kicking my feet in the air with happiness! Kelsey's an amazing character, but she also seems to contradict herself. She's hilarious, feisty, honest and confident.. But also extremely insure not physically but emotionally. She's the perfect mix of lost and broken. Where she'll still be able to live her life.. just not to her fullest extent. Until she meets Hunt. Who has to be thee most chivalrous character I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. I believed the species of gentleman were dead but for sure I am wrong. He's patient, kind hearted and mysterious. Oh and did I mention he's hot? Grey eyes. buzz cut, and muscles that belong on a bow flex commercial. The chemistry between them is pretty great. Though sometimes it came to a point where I just wanted to hit Hunt for being such a pansy! I found myself saying &#34;Oh c'mon.. Seriously?&#34; A lot.Overall,  I feel completely satisfied with the book. I love the way it began and ended. And obviously everything else in between ;) I won't be giving the book five stars because emotionally I couldn't connect with the characters. I loved that they are so dysfunctionally beautiful and I won't be reading 'Seeking Her'. (Prequel - Hunts POV) I definirely recommend the book if you've enjoyed the 'Losing it series' so far! :)",4.0

7610,"Source : Netgalley / Publisher ARCRating : 4.2/5That title had me going. Circle here is a collective noun, so that should pique your interest. The book starts off with a funeral. Good-hearted, skilled plastic surgeon Dr. John Taylor has succumbed to a heart attack in a hotel room. Commanding the funeral is Deborah, his stoic wife of thirty-four years. Then a strange woman shows up to pay her respects. And another. Turns out they&#8217;re all wives of the deceased, only they were completely in the dark about the polygamy. Also hovering close by are the police; there is reason to believe that Dr. Taylor&#8217;s passing was not from natural causes.LaPlante tells the story in first person, from the point of view of each character, one chapter at a time. Each of the characters speaks about their life and relationship to the dead doctor. I loved this because it defines a character via varied points of view, each point of view embellishing a different facet. I get a deep-down portrait of the narrator, but then I also get a portrait of the other characters from the narrator&#8217;s point of view. So I know what Deborah is thinking, and then, I also know what Deborah thinks of MJ and Helen and Samantha. And this back and forth between different points of view is so skillfully done that it all fuses together seamlessly, like one big fantastic tale.I haven&#8217;t read LaPlante before, so am quite blown away by her writing. It is not that she winds her sentences a special way, or uses big words; she just has a way of getting to the heart of the matter, of baring her characters to us, by the way they walk and talk, the way they wear their hair, or obsessively mop up spills. A cardinal rule of story-telling is &#8220;to show&#8221; and not &#8220;to tell&#8221;. And I have to say, LaPlante excels at &#8220;showing&#8221;.Given the tabloid-y nature of the subject, this book could have gone south in the hands of a less accomplished author. With LaPlante&#8217;s considerable skill though, &#8220;A Circle of Wives&#8221; is a hard-to-put-down read.",5.0

Both are difficult topics and they were handled very well by the author.I have to say, I put off reading this book for a couple of weeks after reading the first two. The topic, while handled very, well and not at all in a offensive manner still requires some investment in the emotions of the character and for the reader.I won't give a synopsis of the story, you should read the other two books, I do understand whey they were written as a trilogy and I highly recommend them, I just  couldn't read them one after the other.

She was from a wealthy family that was looked down upon by the revolutionaries. When this event occurred, she was a brilliant young piano student. This became interrupted while she went through the brain-washing to accept the revolutionary thinking. She spent five years in camps to change her thinking. This was successful until she was older and could think rationally. Her status changed and eventually she got back to music and left China for a brief stay in the United States, but finally made her home in Paris. At the age of thirty, she became a concert pianist and discovered Bach's Goldberg Variations which she loved and played often. The writing is average, but the story is the star.

7617,"Typically for a Matthew Scudder novel, the opening chapter of HOPE TO DIE is compelling, suspenseful, just a little bit frightening, and of course, violent.  We learn what horrific events transpired in the home of the Hollanders, as they were met by two intruders who had just ransacked their home, and waited with relative patience for the duo to return so they could finish the job.Chapter one is a gift to fans everywhere of Matthew Scudder the man, as well as Matthew Scudder the Private Detective.  We hear his fears for the victims; we hear, too, his dreams and hopes and even beliefs for how their lives actually ended.  This section of the book is beautifully written; an almost overwhelming sense of loss and mourning pervades the opening chapter and leaves the reader feeling moved and possessing a sense of wonder as to how such strong emotions can be presented to the reader so quickly and with such apparent ease, using blank paper and only a few hundred words.And so it continues in chapter two.  The daughter is the one to find the bodies and naturally she is rescued; turned away from the infinite chasm of loneliness and life long trauma by her evening's date, who just happened to be decent enough to stick around after dropping her off to ensure there were no problems.Characters that long term readers of the series are familiar with, but rarely meet, are introduced again for the first time in the book shortly after as the plot takes an interesting turn.  It also makes a refreshing change for the story to escape (albeit briefly) the confines and classic noir-isms of New York City.The book's first stroke of genius comes with the story's return to the world's greatest metropolis at the end of chapter six.  Scudder hears an interesting theory concerning the daughter of the deceased couple and even though this theory falls flat on its metaphorical face, just the act of crossing town to hear it has got him to thinking.  Favours asked, and favours received, from connections in the crime fighting industry soon lead to unspoken thoughts and Scudder's own sets of theories as to who was behind the horrific murders.  And with TJ along for the ride, it's safe to assume that all bets are off when it comes to finding the disgusting sociopath.HOPE TO DIE is a classic example of the world class detective series we all know and love.  I won't reveal how it all ends here (obviously) and i would not recommend it as a starting point for those new to the series.  As i have said in other reviews of this amazing series, the books are so good they demand to be read in order.  Matthew Scudder's struggles with alcoholism, his wins and his losses all have to be read, lived, and experienced to be believed.  You owe it to yourself, to Scudder and even to Mr Block to walk in the footsteps of the great new age noir hero as he lives through each of these life changing events.Then you will see the truth.Matthew Scudder is a God.And YOU can be one of his disciples.BFN Greggorio!",5.0

7628,"Beautifully written and heartbreakingly emotional, Maybe Someday is an incredibly moving story that has left a mark in my heart!Sydney Blake has always been a music lover, so when neighbour; Ridge Lawson starts playing his guitar on his balcony every night, Sydney is hooked and she soon finds herself sitting outside listening to Ridge's playing every night. When Ridge convinces her to swap phone numbers, the two share their love of music together when he convinces Sydney to write lyrics for his band. It&#8217;s not until Sydney finds out her boyfriend of two years is cheating on her with her best friend, that she is left homeless with no place to go. Luckily for her, Ridge is there to step in and help by offering her a place to stay, however, writing music together can be a personal and intimate experience and they soon have to fight their attraction to one another because Ridge has a girlfriend...one that he won't leave ever. Can these two overcome their attraction to each other while trying to do the right thing, by not becoming unfaithful people?I have to be honest, if the opportunity hadn&#8217;t arisen to read Maybe Someday, I&#8217;m not sure I ever would have gotten to around to it anytime soon. And let me tell you what a big mistake that would have been, because then I would have missed out on this gem of a book.I'm even sure I can express how much I fell in love with this book. Colleen Hoover has written a remarkable book, that I know I won&#8217;t be forgetting for a long time. The way this story written is so heart achingly beautiful that I found myself completely enthralled with it until the very last page. Even now, weeks later, I still find myself thinking about this book because it&#8217;s like no other book I&#8217;ve read. It's definitely high on my re-read list. The reason I feel for this story so much was because I've just read nothing like it before. It's so unique and you can really feel how much heart and soul has gone into the writing of the story. The music aspect really makes it believable and gives you a strong connection to the whole story and the characters. I loved reading the lyrics to the songs and even better, you can actually listen online to the songs sung by Griffin Peterson. And I've listened to some of them, and they are so great and very beautiful because the lyrics are so real to the story.The story itself is not only based on music but also the growing relationship between Sydney and Ridge. The problem is that Ridge does have a girlfriend. Some people may be turned off by the fact that it&#8217;s kind of &#8216;cheating&#8217; book, but before you run away and say no, please believe me when I say read it. It's really not your typical &#8216;cheating&#8217; story where the characters completely disregard everyone&#8217;s feelings and just do whatever they want. No, this is a story about strength, compassion and dedication. Sydney and Ridge work so hard at not making any mistakes. They fight their attraction all the time. As a reader, you're rooting for them so you're just dying for something to happen between them, but you can also understand why it hasn't. The tension is unbelievably sizzling and then combine that with the connection the characters have, it's a tense story, one that's very unpredictable and emotional. And because the story is told from both characters points of view, you really are torn with what's right and wrong. You can feel and see the emotional turmoil they are going through.I absolutely loved Sydney and Ridge. They were two very strong characters that have tried to do the right things. They are both fierce characters and honest characters, and the way they interact with one another is something I won&#8217;t be forgetting for a long time. They open up to each other in many ways they haven&#8217;t with anyone else and their journey is just beautifully remarkable. Sydney was a girl that you could admire - she doesn't judge people and takes things as they are. She's very compassionate and loving and I believe she matched Ridge in every way. And by the end of the story, I was balling like a baby, it's pretty hard not tooAs you can see, I couldn&#8217;t fault Maybe Someday and honestly I&#8217;m glad I can&#8217;t.

7644,"I honestly have not followed a lot of Jim Korkis' blog posts.  I am still a print guy, so for me The Vault of Walt was pretty much all new material.  And there were some essays that I still often reflect on when mulling Disney history.  But with the original printing now out of print and the cheapest copies at the time of this posting starting in the mid $50 range, I just cannot recommend that edition.  Now fortunately it does appear that the price has been dropping thanks to the printing of The Revised Vault of Walt.  But the revised edition did not collect all of the original material.  Could a second volume of this series make all of the original content available at an affordable price?The Vault of Walt Volume 2: More Unofficial, Unauthorized, Uncensored Disney Stories Never Told by Jim Korkis continues in collecting his essays on Disney history.  Like the earlier versions this book is broken into four sections; Walt Disney Stories, Disney Film Stories, Disney Park Stories, and Other Disney Stories.  The essays are not connected and can be read out of order.  Essays printed before include: &#34;Santa Walt&#34;, &#34;Blackbeard's Ghost&#34;, &#34;Captain Eo&#34;, and &#34;Golden Oak Ranch&#34;.  New stories range from &#34;Walt and NASA&#34;, &#34;Secrets of the Santa Cartoons&#34;, &#34;The Birth of the Disneyland Jungle Cruise&#34;, and &#34;The Seven Snow Whites&#34; which show the diversity of the included essays.The Vault of Walt Volume 2 contains 15 new essays.  And honestly some of these essays caught my interest just with their titles matching some of my own personal interests.  I am a huge fan of Roy O. Disney so I enjoyed diving into &#34;Roy O. Disney: The Forgotten Brother Who Built the Magic Kingdom&#34; which does a great job of showing the elder brother's role in getting the Florida resort built.  And &#34;Walt's Chicago&#34; provides background to Walt Disney's relationship with his birthplace.  And of course in the wake of Saving Mr. Banks the essay &#34;Mary Poppins: Walt Disney and P.L. Travers&#34; delves into the story of Disney courting Travers and her opinion of the finished Mary Poppins.The stories themselves are generally short and clear.  They are easy to read and in many cases discuss a piece of Disney history not normally touched on.  It would be an easy book to enjoy on a number of train rides where you stop and start the text over and over again (which may be the way I read this volume).  The majority do read like detailed blogs, and those who have read them before may want more new content.  But I am someone who has only read these tales in the print format.  Yes, in the electronic age I was first exposed to these in a physical form.Let's look at the tale of the tape though.  There are two essays in the original volumes that I cannot find reprinted in The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2.  The  first essay, &#34;Song of the South Premiere&#34; has likely not been reproduced since Korkis now has in print Who's Afraid of the Song of the South which includes a chapter on the premiere.  The second essay, &#34;Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&#34;, is a highly interesting essay on Mickey Mouse in the era of old time radio.  So for half the price of the original volume, you can buy The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2 and lose one essay with the trade off of 20 new ones.  Or one can buy the two Kindle versions for a fifth of the original's current used price.  So I think it is obvious the Between Books recommendation is to buy the two books instead of tracking down a used copy of the original.Fans of Jim Korkis will want The Vault of Walt Volume 2 in their collection.  Serious Disney fans will want this volume for the unique content found in its pages.  And those more casual Disney fans can find plenty of enjoyment within.  And best of all, nearly all of the originally printed essays can be purchased for a reasonable price!Review Copy Provided by Theme Park Press",4.0

The writing is good, the sex scenes are HOT and the emotional intimacy makes a good go of being achingly poignant most of the time. And Max - wow, he's definitely one of my favorite romance heroes. He's so well done, he really comes to life and you really just LIKE him. A lot. And WANT him. ~rowr~But Sara, less so. I liked her well enough, I suppose, but I never loved her and I was frequently annoyed by her. There was something missing in her characterization. It kind of felt like this wasn't the final draft of her character.I also had a problem with the skip-Saturday-through-Thursday-BAM-IT'S-FRIDAY-skip-Saturday-through-Thursday-BAM-IT'S-FRIDAY narrative. The pacing of it just didn't work well for me. I wanted to see them come together more - by accident or not - in between meetings. I wanted those visceral punches of falling in love. Instead, that all sort of slid into place rather suddenly and I felt a bit cheated. I love a lot of sex in my romances, but the sex took up so much space here that there wasn't enough room for everything else.Maybe I would have felt slightly less like that if I had enjoyed the ****SPOILER!!**** public sex scene, because that was certainly a big part of their emotional journey. The authors took a big risk with that one, and it did NOT work for me. There's a biiiig difference between getting off on the risk of getting caught in public, and actually having sex on display in a sex club. ****END SPOILER****The downsides were definitely enough to knock off one, almost two stars for me.

Yes, I enjoyed book one quite a bit, but I enjoyed it even more in conjunction with it's partner Emerald Destiny.Book two begins nearly 20 years after the events of book one. We, again, revisit the lives of Jane and Elias, but we are now joined with their children, twins, Abby and Daniel. These two, much like their parents, have very strong personalities and while they are very individual personalities, they also carry quite a bit of their parents in them, as well as, other family members. Daniel and Abby, also, have a VERY strong connection to each other, however, I felt that Daniel would be much more lost than Abby should they ever be separated for a long period of time.Speaking of connections, do you recall the strong connection that Elias and Jane have? Well, their daughter is dealing with a very similar issue. Evan Reed, son of her mother's ex, is her destiny. She knows it, he knows it and everyone around them knows it, so why are things so difficult? Oh you know...there has to be some form of conflict in every fantasy romance tale, right? It wouldn't be the same if things just fell into place all nice and neatly.Emerald Destiny has a smaller cast of characters than its predecessor, but we are still introduced to some new friend and enemies. Not only do we follow Abby and her brother Daniel, but we continue to learn more about Jane and Elias, which pleased me immensely. Old wounds are opened to reveal past secrets that lead to few answers and more questions. There, of course, is conflict that needs dealt with and lots of romance and lovey dovey stuff that will either make you go &#34;awwwwwwww&#34; or want to wretch.As I mentioned above, I felt that Violet Midnight was much better read along with Emerald Destiny and I am greatly looking forward to reading Amber Passion, which, I believe, is the final book in Then Enchanters Series. I will add that while MUCH better in book two, I still felt that certain scenes were rushed a bit, but not to the point of confusion as I felt in the first book. Overall, a definite fun read that must be read along with its partners to get the full effect.",4.0

7658,This book is exceptionally well written. I found myself caught up in the lives of the characters and the fight to save their friends and the only world they know.Each character is confronted with self discovery and personal growth. The decisions each makes forms and reforms their paths to their destinies.As I read each word I found myself asking if I would have the strength and endurance to face the same personal growth with the same dignity and grace.I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.,5.0

7663,"I actually debated with giving the book three stars, but he steps it up toward the end.I really loved the first full series. It was well written and paced nicely. I think the characters were well written and had easily distinguishable personalities. I liked how Richard was always in action and would deduce truths and when he would explain things to you and the secondary characters, you'd all realize he was right and the clues were there all along.Law of Nines was descent. However, with First Confessor, his work went down hill. He already had a tendency to preach his beliefs with his characters, but he went overboard trying to jam it down your throat without even advancing the story. So it was only about preaching and not good story writing. The worst part was that all his. Characters sounded the same. They didn't have their own voice. If you were to read their lines with no context, you wouldn't be able to tell one from the other.I don't feel like he covered much ground in the first book of this series. Consider that in the first book of the 1rst series, Richard traveled a lot, defeated Darken Rahl, and became Lord Rahl. Goodkind's writing can't survive inaction and that's my biggest gripe with this book. Over half of this book is of Richard sitting in a cave repeating speeches to a young woman before any action happens. I also think there is an issue with lack of voice here. Richard doesn't start acting in the way I've come to know till the end and I feel that some of the characters act realistically to how a person in there situation would. As an example. There is a young girl you'll read about who is much to forceful when talking to The Lord Rahl for a backwoods hick, even considering her small claim to authority. Just think of how you'd act on meeting someone with much less authority than Richard has, say a cop for instance. So that's how I feel about it, but it's still worth the read. You'll have to decide for yourself.",4.0

7669,"I love a dark erotic thriller and this is definitely quite dark, perhaps even a little icky somewhere along the line.  It's definitely enjoyable but there are many other of these kind of books out there at the moment that are quite a lot better.  (I have also read the next in series, left me feeling about the same).  The characterisations are good but for me the writing wasn't that strong and there were too many moments of suspend disbelief where the characters seemed to act out of character or outside of what's vaguely realistic.I like the sweetness of the love between Cove and Sophie and to my mind that saved the book but it didn't have the compulsion and intensity that would lift it above a little better than average.  Something of a pastiche IMO.",3.0
7670,"If you're reading this review, I am assuming you've read the other two books in the series (there's a novella, too, with which I didn't bother). So this book is Jenna and Jimmy's story. Like all the other books, the POV trades off between them.At the beginning of this book, Jenna finds out she is pregnant from a one night stand. It wouldn't be a big deal except that the author decides the identity of the father should be a ""secret"", even from the reader. However, the idea that we don't know who the father is from page one, is laughable. It's almost offensive the way the author thinks the reader is so obtuse that we are supposed to be surprised when the father is ""revealed"" around page 70.What's more annoying is the vague dialogue used to mask the father's identity (inner dialogue too!! Like the characters are keeping the information from themselves!! So stupid!!) and waffling behavior by both Jenna and Jimmy (though ESPECIALLY Jimmy). Truthfully, I couldn't tell WHO Jimmy wanted to be with as he was talking about how he could easily fall back into a relationship with his ex, Chelsea, if she'd just say the word. That was on like page 20. Then all of a sudden, he's been thinking about Jenna for months? What?Then they take a huge step for no reason. But then, there might be a reason. But then there IS a reason, they just didn't know it. Maybe. This all happens in about ten pages. It doesn't really invest the reader with any kind of faith in their feelings for each other. Or even make the reader care, at all, if they get together.Then there's Jenna's ex husband, who is evidently Batman, as he can not be captured or stopped even in a closed venue or small town while being actively tailed by police. And I just want to put this out there--has the author EVER been to a rock concert? Because they routinely search for cameras, drugs and weapons. Just saying.The other books weren't works of genius but at least the characters were likable and their actions appeared to have some kind of logic to them. This book seemed to have been written by the author after staying up for five days straight, maybe with a hangover.Little continuity and even less possibility of engagement with any main character. The whole story was ridiculous from start to finish. If I hadn't wanted to write this review, I would have tossed the book at page 40. Seriously.I would have given one star except in this book, this rock band finally--FINALLY--has an actual rock concert! Only took 500 or so pages. I've never seen a story about a famous rock band with so little actual music happening. They play gigs in a bar in their tiny town and practice a lot but that's about it.And will we EVER know why the band is called 4225 West?? It's a really specific name, suggesting history or an address or place of significance. So why are we never told WTH it means?? Also, if it means nothing, it's a mouthful to say so not really great marketing technique on the band's part.Did I miss this explanation? Please let me know, if so.In any case, I was just kind of so-so about this series until this book. Now, I'm sorry I read any of them. Waste of money and time.Hopefully, my loss is your gain. Don't bother.One last note to all writers of rock stories out there: just because you wrote a book, and some of you have talent doing that, doesn't mean you can write a song. It is an entirely different animal. I am tired of reading the horrible, poorly metered lyrics these writers churn out, as if someone is going to read it and produce their song. Please, just stop. Describe the song and lyrics and how it makes the character feel. But if you really don't know how to write lyrics, then please refrain.Thanks.",2.0

7672,"I used to devour mysteries constantly, and then I just kind of . . . stopped.  But I still pick them up now and then.  Turns out the way to get me really interested in your mystery is to give it a cute little sweater-like cover of a moose hanging.  And in a way, that really sums up the book.Friendship, Wisconsin is a friendly small town with a population of less than 700.  The most violent anyone gets is hunting deer, which is a matter of self preservation.  (Otherwise, they go into the road and the deer and the drivers die.)  Thus the town is rocked by the violent murder of Ruth Fried, particularly Kippy Bushman.  Ruth was Kippy's best friend and on her way to her house when she died.  Kippy feels guilty, but it's not until she talks to Ruth's brother that she realizes there might be more to the case than Ruth's hoodlum boyfriend getting violent.NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU is an interesting blend of tones.  The back compares it to Fargo, which is an obvious inspiration, but the humor isn't quite the same.  NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU has a ton more quirk for one thing.  But it's got the violence too.  The description of what happened to Ruth is absolutely awful.  There's a great deal of funny in NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU, but Ruth's death is never funny.  I'm going to mark that as a point in the book's favor.I enjoyed how the mystery developed.  There's a bunch of suspects for a town where everyone is too nice to be a suspect.  And I liked that the killer wasn't obvious.  It starts to become clear, but only at the same point that Kippy starts putting it together.  I also liked how Kippy's investigation is impeded by the police, who believe that the crime is solved and she's simply overly distraught.  (Kippy had a small mental breakdown following her mother's death years before.)If you're looking for a creepy, funny read with a hint of romance, look no farther than NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU.  I'd avoid it if you're allergic to all things quirky or twee, but otherwise it's quite fun.",4.0

7675,"***Received from author for an honest review***(This is a short story/novella. This review is not based on story length but story content as length has very little to do with how much I enjoy a book.)Wow! I was blown away by this little story. Told in first person, we&#8217;re given front row seats to watch love blossom between Leah and Nate.Both are successful and seem to know what they want. They fall hard, fast, and unexpectedly for each other. Their love takes time to grow, more than a few days, more than a few weeks or months, and it was beautiful to watch.I loved how they seemed to give their all to each other, but that adoration faded when Nate started disappearing for longer periods of time, appearing in Leah&#8217;s life when it was convenient for him. I felt for Leah each time she put her life on hold, each time she wondered where he was, each time she slipped into despondency.This story offers two alternate endings. True, most romances end with an absolute HEA, but this one gives the reader a chance to choose the ending they prefer. I won&#8217;t give them away, you&#8217;ll have to read to find out, but both endings are thought provoking and completely probable.This is my first story by Ms. Ross, and I&#8217;m more than pleased with what she&#8217;s written.",5.0
7676,"(3.5 stars) Sandy is on his way to meet his wife, Emily at the animal shelter she volunteers at in New York City. He is killed in an accident on the icy street. Sandy is offered a second chance at life if he goes back to right some of his wrongs towards Emily. He agrees but is upset to find out that he has come back as a stray at the shelter, Einstein. Emily has her own problems, such as finding out that her husband never left her the apartment in the Dakota as he had agreed to, and finding out from his journals that he was cheating on her. Emily is determined to find a way to stay in the apartment, despite her mother-in-law's insistence that she move out. Emily is also dealing with some major changes where she works a a small boutique publisher that has been acquired by a larger firm. Adding to her load is a visit from her sister, who is much more of a free spirit. She plans on writing about their mother, an early advocate for women's rights. Einstein must help nudge Emily towards resolving her past and moving towards a future, but sometimes his own motivations get in the way. What could have been a run-of-the-mill chick lit book actually has some interesting twists and turns, and it pleasantly surprised me. The book has some bittersweet moments, but comes to a satisfying, and more realistic conclusion than one would initially expect.",4.0

Same with the self defense classes I found myself skipping ahead.

7681,"Vimanas have long been of interest, so I bought this book with high hopes.  The prospect of flying craft in the skies of ancient India is inherently interesting, and if true, raises a multitude of questions that demand answers.  Unfortunately, Childress's book adds little to the vimana lore or understanding.  There are, to be fair, some meaningful portions of the book, but the organization frequently keeps one on the fringes of the topic or veers into topics only loosely related .  What works against the credibility and is the most damaging is the author's strange choice to include the &#34;Vimanika Shastra&#34; document as a source.  He admits the work is highly questionable and was, most likely, &#34;channeled&#34; to the writer, and yet he devotes a whole chapter to it and ends up treating it as a valid source.

7722,"I was given an ARC of this new short story collection. My review is an honest account of my feelings. I enjoyed the three stories very much. All well-written in the author's distinctive style. The stories, set in and around North Wales, have vivid descriptions of the area, the countryside and the buildings we visit and show the author's love of her adopted homeland. The characters are well rounded and easy to get along with. Each story has a very different theme of home and relationships, some humor, and endings that will leave you wondering... A highly recommended read.",5.0
7723,"I am 8 years old and I think that the pictures are really cute, and the rhyming was awesome! I like rhyming a lot. And the ways the ladybird and the leopard got their spots was very creative! My favourite character was Andrew(the main character ).It&#8217;s a really really good book and ends very well.The best part was when he got the spots and I felt sad for Andrew the giraffe when he had no spots but the ending was a happy one and the rhyming through the whole book was really fun. This is my favourite book from this author and my brothers&#8217; favourite from this author was Goodnight, Sleep Tight.

7725,"Very well written book, detailing the horrors of the concentration camps and the Nazi regime. The book is well researched, and as the story unfolds, you cannot help feeling sad at the loss of so many lives, and the fact that most of the world did not believe that such atrocities could happen, and failed to react quickly. On the other hand, the book presents many brave people who dared to help, even at the expense of their lives, restoring my belief that there is still hope for humanity.

7730,"I agree with a reviewer who said that this isn't the whole story. That's true and honestly it's stupid of the book to claim otherwise. But it was nice to read, nice to have something that I could relate to and put on myself to feel proud. I'm still the punk kid I always was, and I will be even when I'm in a nursing home. But when I was that young punk teenager books like this didn't exists and I didn't think they ever would so for that I am grateful.Maybe...maybe some of it we don't want everyone to be able to pick up and read. Maybe those of us who considered and still consider ourselves true punks will keep some stuff and some bands like Bikini Kill to ourselves and we'll smile at each other and understand our secret code.

7736,"Welcome to HELL!Melody Angel is a temp at the HELL Corporation. She seems to be the only angel in a place full of demons. Her mission is to find where Lucifer is hiding and find out what he is really up to. With Luce Iblis being her number one suspect, the smoldering hot CEO just adds plenty of trouble and temptation to her work.Oh what a fun story, I really enjoyed this one. Melody is really an angel, she is sweet, calm and calculating and overall takes her situation in stride. The books main focus was mostly on Mel as she stumbles through HELL trying to figure out which one of her co-workers is Lucifer. So with a little bit of mystery added to keep the book exciting as well as some office humor and satire made this book very enjoyable.The pace of the book varied, it started out fast and kind of slowed down a bit in the middle and picked up really in the end. I liked the ending and how everything fell together, but it left me wanting more. Especially with all the interesting and amusing characters of HELL Corporation and their reactions to Mel.Thought there was some dirty jokes thrown into the book, it was relatively clean. I absolutely enjoyed watching Melody in that environment and her dislike of the office instant sludge coffee!I got a copy of this book from the tour coordinator in exchange of an honest review.",4.0
7737,For me this book falls under the category of what could have been.  This is an interesting premise but its a little bit to &#34;artsy&#34; for me.  Its like one of those paintings where you know what all the little bits are but they look just a little odd and they don't quite fit together properly.  Lots of people are into that kind of thing so if you are this is a good book for you.  If you are looking just to be entertained then I would look for something else.,3.0
7738,"Awakening. Honesty. Action. Separate from each other, and there's not much to go with. Together, however, and there's a moment there, of connection with HaShem, that's supposed to change it all. Or at least Idleman asserts. There are plenty of reviewers that have tackled this very question. Additionally, I'm not reviewing the book, but rather the audiobook. When reviewing an audiobook, the purpose of the review is to ascertain if the audio is one worth listening to. So, on my end, I will assume that you will have decided on the content material, but now you are at a point where you need to decide on traditional reading format or auditory listening format.Heyborne's narration is clear and easy to understand. He reads at a medium pace and pauses slightly in-between sentences to allow readers to keep up. A softer voice, Heyborne's is not one I would mind listening to in the background or while on a drive. Overall, the audiobook edition is a quality edition to consider, breaking out of the mold of subpar quality and providing a voice that can match the author's intent. So, if you're on the fence on reading versus listening, this title is a good title to give audiobooks a go.Disclosure: I was contracted to write an honest review in exchange for a reviewer copy of the product.

7743,"I was given a free copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review as part of the M/M Romance group Don't Buy My Love project.If you are truly a Trecky (idk how you spell that) then you will really enjoy this story. And the story really does capture that &#34;Go where no man has gone before&#34; theme.I thought there was a nice pace to the book except for the huge data dump at the beginning with quite a few POV's provide so I was a little confused at first. But then the story really started to flow. This story is not a straight forward m/m romance there is more focus on the actual story than romance...which in my opinion wasn't bad.The story takes place well into the future where space travel is as common and just as regular as commercial flight. I don't want to say the main characters are Edward and Martin because everyone in this story had huge rolls and played key parts that without them the story would be lost. The Starfire Corp has developed a way to travel to the far reaches of the universe in a blink of an eye and there are those from the future that want to make that not happen. We do find out some reasons that some from the future don't want that to happen but there is another party at play who his even more driven to see that the mission fails.I loved the build up of everything the sabotage, the space mission, the murders, and the love story.

7749,"I didn&#8217;t need to read more than a couple of lines of the synopsis of The Martian before I knew I had to read this book.  I love stories set in space, and in this one, the main character is stranded alone on Mars after his NASA crewmates leave him behind, thinking he&#8217;d died in an accident.  He has no way to get off the planet and no way to communicate with NASA.  His only hope is to find a way to stay alive for several years until the next mission to Mars arrives.  This is an amazing set-up, isn&#8217;t it?  And The Martian had the good fortune to come out around the same time that the film, Gravity, with a similar theme of one person struggling to survive away from Earth, was racking up Oscars.The story drew me right in.  How could this astronaut, Mark Watney, find the means to get oxygen, water, and food on a barren planet?  How will he maintain the will to survive alone for years, when the chances for his rescue seem hopeless?  If he does manage to make it until the next mission arrives, how will he find them?  The Martian is written in the form of Watney&#8217;s diary, so we are right there with him as he gets into planning mode.  And he IMMEDIATELY gets into this mode, after a thorough assessment of his dire situation.  He calculates the amount of water and food he needs for the next few years, down to the liter and calorie.  He is trained as an engineer and botanist, so if all goes according to plan, he can maintain his equipment to provide oxygen and water, and he has the ability to grow potatoes.I initially found all of this fascinating.  It reminded me a lot of Not a Drop to Drink by Mindy McGinnis, in that the author made what could have been very dry facts seem interesting.  But after a time, it got to be too much.  I assume Andy Weir did an enormous amount of research for this book, because it reads like a step-by-step instruction manual for how to survive on Mars.  But that&#8217;s where the problems started to set in for me.  It began to become a never-ending series of: &#8220;This terrible thing X happened, but I fixed it by doing Y.&#8221;  I started to become unconcerned for Watney, because this guy had an answer for everything.Very early on &#8211; TINY SPOILER HERE &#8211; the book switches out of diary mode, and moves to NASA headquarters.  Through a major stroke of luck, an employee viewing satellite images discovers that Watney is alive, and unbeknownst to him, they begin to plan a dangerous rescue mission, with a high likelihood for failure.  These scenes provided a nice break from the increasing monotony of Watney&#8217;s experience on Mars.Through everything, Watney has an incredibly (and almost unbelievably) positive outlook.  He never seemed to despair, and he never seemed very angry.  He approached each day with a list of tasks that he methodically checked off.  At times, he seemed to find a good deal of humor in his situation.  Maybe these are qualities that astronauts need to possess, but it made it difficult to sympathize with his plight.Despite my few reservations, I would recommend this to any sci-fi fan.  There are good reasons why it has over 5k ratings on Goodreads with a nearly 4.40 average.Note: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",3.0
7750,"Twelfth in the Sister Frevisse medieval mystery series and revolving around Dame Frevisse, a Benedictine nun, and Joliffe, a player-writer turned spy for the bishop. Events take place in Bury St. Edmunds in England in 1447.If you're following the Sister Frevisse stories (and if you enjoyed her Joliffe, the Player series), you must read this one as events in this affect Frevisse and her relationship with Alice and Bishop Beaufort. Joliffe also plays in this.My TakeIt's not a typical Frevisse, for there's only the one bit of detecting&#8212;and Frevisse does have help from Joliffe and Pecock. Even Beaufort is stepping out of his usual role!This story does make me grateful for the Internet and a justice system with rules and regulations. Yes, those rules can get put aside---hello NSA, CIA, FBI---but it's more than Gloucester had back in 1447. Jesus.This is a sad tale with no happily-ever-after for anyone. It's mostly a tale of greed, but a greed for power, not money with actions that destroy families. Yes, there are politics involved, but no real discussion of strategy or true affairs of state. The best is simply mentions of Suffolk's influence on the king and how Suffolk's ego is affecting his relationship with Alice. I can't imagine future installments without Alice, so it will be interesting to see how Frazer resolves this.My favorite part is the play Wilde is putting on. It's a brilliant-sounding piece, and I do wish I could have been there. Joliffe is his usual witty self even as he's flying about, trying to do what he can for the bishop.There's a mention of Chaucer's translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, Boece, and it sounds like an interesting read. One to pick up, read a few pages, and think about it before continuing for another few. I very much appreciated Pecock's assessment of confession and penance. Such a very realistic viewpoint.The best of The Bastard's Tale is the why of all these people helping Arteys who's between a rock and a hard place; there are none of whom he would have expected to find aid. It's too bad there aren't more people willing to step up this way. Luckily, he does make good choices under the circumstances. Now if only Gloucester had been a bit more suspicious and Henry paying more attention...The StoryLured by the promise of his beloved wife's pardon, the out-of-favor Gloucester travels to Bury St. Edmunds where Parliament has been moved. And so gather the spies of lords and bishops.The CharactersDame Frevisse is a Benedictine nun at St. Frideswide with the Lady Alice of Suffolk her cousin. Suffolk has the king's ear and believes himself his equal. John de la Pole is the four-year-old Suffolk son and heir with his own part to play. Domina Elisabeth is still the prioress, and she sends Frevisse and Dame Perpetua as companion at the request of Henry Beaufort, Cardinal and Bishop of Winchester to spy for him in Bury. It's Sister Amicia who accompanies Frevisse back to London.Arteys is the bastard son of the Duke of Gloucester with no sense of his place or future. Humphrey, the Duke of Gloucester, is, until Henry has an heir, the heir to the throne of England with the Duke of York behind him. Gloucester's men include Sir Richard Middleton, Gryffydd ap Nicholas, Sir Roger Chamberlain, Yevan ap Jankyn, Jenkin ap Rhys, Master Richard Needham who is the member of Parliament for Dover and employed by Gloucester, Tom Herbert, Hal, Sir John Cheney, and Sir Robert Wer. Gloucester's wife, the Lady Eleanor, has been imprisoned for the past five years for witchcraft.Master Wilde is producing a play to present to the king as a gift from Abbot Babington. Wilde's wife, Joane, puts Frevisse to work hemming costumes. His son, Giles, has a part. John Lydgate is a Benedictine monk pushing to impose his taste upon the company.Master Noreys, a.k.a., Joliffe, is the Devil in so many ways.Master Grene is the warden of St. Saviour's where Gloucester will stay along with the king. Bishop Pecock of St. Asaph is a minor religious figure with a quick intellect. Runman is his servant, and Master Orle is his chaplain. Both are willing to do whatever the bishop needs. Brother Adam is in charge of the library and is forced to allow Dame Perpetua in.Isabella Tresham's husband, William, is Speaker for the Commons in Parliament.King Henry VI and his queen, Margaret, are in the toils of the Marquis of Suffolk. Sir John Stourton and Sir Thomas Stanley are lickspittles for Henry. The Marquis of Dorset, the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Salisbury, Viscount Beaumont, and Lord Sudeley are some of Suffolk's cronies. Edward Griggs is one of his yeomen.The CoverThe cover is a pale golden yellow split vertically with the left a long perspective of the river with its variously arched bridges and homes lining the banks. The right side is text-filled with the blue foil-backed title, the series name, the author's name, and informational data.The title is true enough, for it's The Bastard's Tale Frazer tells.",4.0
7751,"The Word Exchange by Alena Graedon has a fascinating premise. In the near future, the printed word is all but dead. Nearly everyone in the U.S. has a device called a Meme. Even better than a Smartphone, Memes intuit what their owners need. Need a cab? Your Meme will hail one before you even realize it. Searching for a word? Your Meme will quickly find it for you on the Word Exchange, for only a few cents per word.Then people start showing signs of the Word Flu &#8211; using nonsense words instead of real ones, to the point where they can&#8217;t be understood. A powerful company has been buying up the rights to all the English words in the world, so Meme users have to pay more each time their Memes find a word for them. Copies of the last print edition of a great American dictionary are being burned; pretty soon the only place to look up words will be the Word Exchange. That and the Oxford English Dictionary, the lone holdout against greedy corporate interests.Although I have a Smartphone, I do worry about the influence of digital devices and social media on our lives. When one goes out for a meal with family or friends, one or more of the people present are constantly checking their devices. Studies show autocomplete functions when we text or write are changing the way we communicate, as many people are too lazy to find the word they mean and accept the generic word everyone is using instead.This book certainly taps into my own fears about what is happening in society. The author of a paper put out by the book&#8217;s word &#8220;underground resistance&#8221; writes, &#8220;Our facility for reflection has dimmed, taking with it our skill for deep and unfettered thinking.&#8221; (p. 85) I&#8217;ve had this thought myself, and ranted the following along with one of the characters:As a nation, we&#8217;ve been practicing mass production since before World War II. We believed wastefulness would morph, by magic, into wealth. That if we created enough disposable products, it would help fire consumerism. And it did, for a while. But here&#8217;s a dirty secret: resources are finite. Waste enough, and eventually it&#8217;s all used up. (p. 345)The Word Exchange is broken into 26 chapters, one for each of the letters in the English alphabet. Each chapter starts with a word and a definition. Although I loved the concept of this book, it&#8217;s not perfect. I had a very hard time following some plot points. There are two narrators, and one of them is suffering from the Word Flu. His chapters are filled with nonsense words, which got old very fast. But the book has a satisfying ending, and I recommend it to other readers interested in where technology is taking us. If you enjoyed Ready Player One, Amped, or A Working Theory of Love, you might enjoy The Word Exchange.I read an advance reader copy of The Word Exchange.",4.0
7752,"Contemporary, Fallen Angels, Young AdultBoise, IdahoAirel is a 17-year-old that just wants to be normal.  Living in the small city of Boise she seems like just any other average teenager.  But soon those days are gone as she undergoes a change so drastic that she has to wonder if she didn&#8217;t just imagine it happening.  Airel soon has to learn to fight for her life as she is being pursued by an ancient enemy.  An enemy that will pursue her relentlessly in the deepest darkness.  Simply because of her lineage and who she is.  Now she will never have what she wanted most of all to be normal.This book starts the series off with a bang.  The suspense builds throughout the story and draws the reader in until they have to keep reading just to see what is actually happening and why it is happening.  As this story doesn&#8217;t give all the answers it will have readers wanting to read the next book just to see what happens next.  With every piece that is revealed it leads to more questions that make for a book that is a page turner.  The characters are very interesting and complex.  The story is almost two stories in one as it also gives the story of what has happened in the past while telling the story that is happening in the current time.  The two periods are woven together seamlessly so that the reader is never at a lost as to what is happening.  If the other books continue like the first this is going to be an explosive series.  It does leave a cliffhanger at the end that hopefully picks up in the next book.",5.0
7753,"Like many people I have a love/hate relationship with social media. I like that I can keep up with some distant friends and family this way, but it's mostly just noise, at best meaningless, at worst it makes me dissatisfied and/or angry (I know that during the Charleston area's recent and continuing water crisis Facebook began as a great place to exchange information, but has now gotten to the point that my husband begs me not to look at it). I also resent all the time I waste reading about things I don't really care about and there is so much pressure to keep up. Anyway, a perfect topic for a writer like Eggers to take on and while I know a lot of people were underwhelmed by the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - a solid 4.5 stars, even though it made me want to immediately go off the grid and pay only cash for items.Mae is over-educated and under-employed. Her college roommate, Annie manages to get her a job with her company, The Circle similar to Facebook only much bigger and encompassing more of everyday life (though the campus seems to have been modeled on Microsoft's) - ""the company had so much going on, so much humanity and good feeling, and was pioneering on all fronts, that she knew she was being improved just by being in the Circlers' proximity. It was like a well-curated organic grocery store: you knew, by shopping there, that you were healthier; you couldn't make a bad choice, because everything had been vetted already."" (105)Mae becomes more and more enmeshed in life at (and in) the Circle, to the point in ruins most relationships she had prior to her new job. Her father is suffering from MS (one of the most successful parts of the books, I thought) and Mae's new job is, initially, a boon, but then becomes something darker for her family and old friends. In a conversation with her old boyfriend he notes, ""'listen, twenty years ago, it wasn't so cool to have a calculator watch, right? And spending all day inside playing with your calculator watch sent a clear message that you weren't doing so well socially. And judgments like 'like' and 'dislike' and 'smiles' and 'frowns' were limited to junior high. Someone would write a note and it would say, 'Do you like unicorns and stickers?' and you'd say, 'Yeah, I like unicorns and stickers! Smile!' That kind of thing. But now it's not just junior high kids who do it, it's everyone, and it seems to me sometimes I've entered some inverted zone, some mirror world where the dorkiest s*** in the world is completely dominant. The world has dorkified itself.'"". (133) Separate from the larger social issues Eggers does a good job showing how annoying it can all become (the issues with Alistair and the pushiness of total strangers rang very true). Though the last third of the book relied a bit heavily on 1984 and the aquarium section was a bit overwhelming, the end was both inevitable and incredibly interesting.Most readers will have no doubt about the big secret or be very surprised about the progression of the action, but even though much of what occurred was expected Eggers uses his gift for dialogue and creation of real characters (who of us hasn't been incredibly envious of friends, annoyed with parents or dated a person he/she didn't really care about?) to overcome the lack of suspense and did a great job showing how insidiously easy it can be to head down the slope. I couldn't wait to see how Eggers ""completed the circle"" of the novel.",5.0

7757,"Evocative, lyrical story with such a strong sense of place that you'll swear you're staggering through a rural Alaska winter.The ending is so wonderful that I wept, and then I read the last few pages again. And I wept again.But I'm getting ahead of myself.For the beginning didn't sweep me up. I struggled. The transitions between the present and past segments stuttered and felt disjointed. More frustrating yet, these transitions occur so frequently that they offered me little chance to know the characters, to sink down inside of them and feel their stories.I still don't know if this was intended by the author as a way of keeping the reader slightly off-center, if it was a device to mirror the action and tension of the storyline.Whatever the case, things changed around Page 60. Suddenly, I was IN the book. I breathed it. I felt it. I was there.And I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up most of the night--I couldn't put the book down. And I still can't stop thinking about it.Rayna, the blind girl, has to be the strongest and most endearing character I'm come across in a long time.All in all, I highly recommend the &#34;The Raven's Gift.&#34;",4.0

7767,"If you happen to be a student of English battles,wars, factions, divisions,political associations,etc., or  happen to have lived in past centuries in order to appreciate the finer points, you may  love this.  In case not, it will be reduced to a tragic romance with a lame heroine.  Very interesting,although possibly not for 450 pages.  DuMaurier  was so good at writing with an edge, such as My Cousin Rachel, The Scapegoat, etc.,  that anything else pales by comparison.  But- she wanted to be known as a &#34;serious&#34; writer.  For my part- I have long considered  Frenchmans Creek  one of the half dozen most outstanding and original novels in all literature.",3.0

7774,"&#8220;Goshawk Squadron&#8221; is a novel by author Derek Robinson about a fictional squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (the predecessors of the Royal Air Force) in early 1918, during World War I.  But rather than this being a story about happy young men fighting a chivalrous war in the air against other similarly chivalrous young men, this novel shows what it was really like &#8230; a brutal, unsympathetic struggle where the pilots from both sides strove to ambush and kill their adversary before said adversary even knew he was there.  I don&#8217;t give spoilers in my reviews of fictional works, below are my impressions of this book.While the book touches all of the pilots in the squadron, it centers around the young, bitterly cynical commander, Major Woolley.  Robinson shows him as an eccentric, yet harshly effective commander, who is close to coming apart from the stress of his position.  The author gives interesting portraits of the replacement pilots coming into the squadron &#8230; young idealist men, who have no idea how the reality of the air war compares to the popularly idealized, sanitized version that they believed, and their gradual disillusionment delivered courtesy of Major Woolley.  Robinson writes in a darkly humorous way, that accurately describes the struggles both on the ground and in the air (although the air combat often becomes horrifying).A few years ago, I read &#8220;Winged Victory&#8221;, a semi-autobiographical novel by RFC pilot V.M. Yeates about the air war in France in 1918 flying Sopwith Camels.  Mr Yeates based his novel on his own experiences in the Royal Flying Corps in 1918, and the novel was widely acclaimed as being an authentic description of what it was actually like to live and fly in combat during World War I.  Although unlike Yeates, Robinsion obviously did not fly/fight aircraft in World War I, to me, &#8220;Goshawk Squadron&#8221; has the same ring of authenticity that I had when reading &#8220;Winged Victory&#8221;.  I highly recommend this book.  Five stars.",5.0
7775,"Prepare for a little shock and awe - Raptor 6 was a thrill to read! From cover to cover Ronie Kendig&#8217;s &#8220;Rapid-Fire Fiction&#8221; will keep you turning pages. This was my first experience with the Christian Suspense genre and Ronie Kendig knocked my socks off. Kendig knows a thing or two about military operations and culture and she has clearly done her research for Raptor 6. She delivers a well constructed novel with nail-biting suspense, pulse-pounding action, and heart wrenching drama.Raptor 6 is a highly trained Army Special Forces team. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each member of the team over the course of the book. Each man had an assigned specialty and a unique personality that contributed to the cohesiveness of the unit. The banter between them was &#8220;clean&#8221; and the occasional use of expletives were done using made up phrases. I laughed out loud at the humorous ribbing that they gave one another. Their playful joking worked nicely to break up the tension in the more suspenseful moments.Captain Dean Watters is a born leader who inspires esprit de corps among his men. I grew to admire him as a man of strong character who is committed to his country and his team. He is a precision instrument of war - intelligent, focused and controlled. His desire to control circumstance and provide for the safety of others stems from a past that the author does an excellent job of revealing over time.Raptor 6 is more than military might and maneuvering, there is a romance that evolves between Zahrah Zarrick and Capt. Watters. Missionary Zahrah Zarrick won me over with her BOLD faith. She is a woman who is on fire for Christ and has completely surrendered herself to His service. Her resolve to trust God for her protection despite the turmoil around her baffles Capt. Watters. He lets himself believe that he is merely covering his six, looking out for retired General Peter Zarrick&#8217;s daughter, but there is something about Zahrah that he can&#8217;t escape.Keep in mind that this novel takes place in present day Afghanistan during a US military war on terrorism. These characters fight monumental spiritual battles as well as a physical dangers. The book has violence to include violence against women that may be difficult for some to read. Kendig does a tactful job of incorporating these egregious acts into a redeeming storyline.Ronie Kendig honors those who serve(d) in our military and has won a new fan. I strongly recommend Raptor 6 to men and women for it&#8217;s intricate plot and powerful message. I anxiously await the next book in The Quiet Professionals Series and give this Christian military suspense novel 5 stars! Buy it!",5.0
7776,"BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND IAN EVERSEA is the ninth book in the Pennyroyal Green series.  Ian Eversea, the rogue who famously attempted to seduce the Duke of Falconbridge's fiancee in WHAT I DID FOR A DUKE and ended up going home naked, meets the Duke's ward Titania ""Tansy"" Danforth.  Tansy is an American heiress who has come to England to find a husband approved by the Duke.I really liked this book because it was about how people create masks to hide pain in their lives.  Both Tansy and Ian have created superficial flirty personalities in order to keep people at a distance.  While at first these two appear superficial, they are actually hiding depths that are discovered when they are together.At the same time, this book is very funny.  The reactions of men to Tansy are simply hysterical.  Men are just entranced with her.  The subtle competition over flowers with Olivia and the reactions of the other women in the book was also amusing.  At the same time, we see Tansy's caring nature in how she treats people.  My favorite part of the book is her list of qualities she desires in a husband which she adds to throughout the book.I also enjoyed spending time with the Duke and Genevieve again.  Because of the situation, Falconbridge is a significant part of this book and his actions in this book made me like him even more than before.While not necessary to read all the books in the series before this one (though I highly recommend starting at the beginning and reading all nine), I believe that a reader will enjoy this book better if they read at least WHAT I DID FOR A DUKE because of the continuation of the story from that book.Finally, I really hope the next book us about Olivia and Lyon because the events of this book leave me concerned.",4.0
7777,"This is a good story, though too short to be considered a novel. I really appreciated the Christian theme. But the whole way through, the plural spelling of words was wrong.  An apostrophe indicates possession.  A plural does not require an apostrophe. Also a lack of understanding for there/their(s). There's would be short for there is.  If an author does not have a clear understanding of this, then the proofreader needs to be someone who does. This drives me crazy!!  And I suspect there are many others who feel the same. I also would have liked to know the the final word on Maddie. Maybe that is for the next book. I hope so!  Good job. Just needs a little tweaking.",4.0
7778,"I've been waiting for an author to hear my silent prayer for a paranormal romance set in the roaring twenties. I've always been fond of the era with its iconic fashion and there are fewer times in history that seem as fun to drop a paranormal plot in than one already plagued by prohibition. Enter one of the very small handful of authors I pre-order without reading blurbs for, the sharp and sagacious Jenn Bennett.While the blurb for BITTER SPIRITS does a very wonderful job of presenting the basics of what you'll be reading I realized right away that as a reader of her urban fantasy series first I was mildly disappointed. I'm just so used to her voice without the romance as the central plot that it felt slow to take off. Once it did though, I struggled to put it down. A thorough researcher and quite impressively able to blend unexpected things together, Bennett made the odd mix of Chinese and Swedish characters and cultures truly immersive. I hated to be pulled away to scenes with just Aida and Winter&#8212;and mercy do they have chemistry!&#8212;simply because I was so invested in the world.When I was able to let go of the plethora of unique and enjoyable secondary characters long enough I really enjoyed the romance itself. Aida and Winter are a great couple, the sort you root for from the instant they meet. They're both a bit wounded and plagued by things they're not ready to tell one another which keeps them from falling in love too quickly. When they come together intimately it's scorching but not gratuitous, something I very much appreciated considering the era.By the time I finished BITTER SPIRITS I had run a gamut of emotions, become very fond of some secondary characters I hope get their own romantic tales later in the series, and decided I had to pre-order GRIM SHADOWS. It's not as thick on the paranormal elements as I'd love&#8212;what can I say? I'm addicted to monsters&#8212;but it's a ferocious romp with ghostly elements I think both paranormal romance readers and historical romance readers should give a taste.Notes: ARC received via author.",4.0

Sydney is put in charge of protecting a royal moroi girl while the queen tries to throw out the law that is endangering the royal's life. She is also trying to reprove herself as trustworthy to her superiors.I am very pleased and happy that Richelle Mead decided to write a spin off series of The Vampire Academy. I was sad when the series ended. I even loved the way she tied it in so nicely to the previous series. It was absolutely amazing.The only thing I didn't really like all that much was the fact that the main character wasn't a moroi or dhamphir. I understand why she made Sydney the main character. It was her story after all. I just feel that Sydney being the main character made the story a little more stiff than if it was someone else. That's just my opinion though. Either way, the story was very enjoyable.I feel like I'm going to love this series as much as I did the Vampire Academy series. I fully recommend this book series to young adults and anybody who loves paranormal and supernatural books. I especially recommend it to all Vampire Academy lovers.",5.0

It was set at a school where all the boys are giants and this guy, Joel, is a giant too, but he doesn't know why. But they are all sons of fallen angels which are called nephlim in the book and I guess that is from the Bible. This girl Rachel lives with her weird cousin and aunt, and she falls in love with Joel even though she was afraid of him at first. It helps that he saves her from the other nephlim who are evil. The nephlim are all in this project to be trained for war, and it is really pretty exciting because everybody is against Joel because he is better than they are.",5.0

How two different worlds could collide and combine and thrive when everything is trying to break them up, only shows more how true love and music can unite people.I cheered for TNT and booed those trying to tear them apart, and with 12% left to go in the book, I though my heart was going to leap out of my chest.

7791,"My first read with this author and I've already started on the second book.  I love historical romances and I looked forward to seeing if My Evans would be added to my faves.  Glad to say, she was added. At first, it was a little slow to get to the action, but once we got through the mutual attraction that each of the hero/heroine wasn't aware that the other felt it was smooth sailing. The physical description of the scars on Christian made me wince at times such was the author's ability to be precise without becoming morbid. We begin with our hero, Lord Markham, an Adonis come down to earth, returning from the battle at Waterloo, shunned by the same society who once worshipped him, he now has to pay for his pleasure. During one of his forays, he's accused of a heinous crime against a debutante. Forced to flee, he vows to return to England and clear his name. Lady Serena Castleton, daughter of a duke and a beauteous debutante, is literally &#34;sold&#34; in marriage to settle her father's numerous gambling debts. She finds out the hard way, that her marriage is no fairy-tale as he subjects her to heinous acts of depravity. Knowing she has to escape or die, she makes a break for freedom and answers an add for a governess to Lord Markham's ward..Lily. The author skillfully takes us on the journey back to England which is not without it's dangers. Lily cannot allow him to know who she really is especially since she has loved him from afar for as long as she can remember. The emotions that are evident between these two are so steamy as to make one blush. You can almost envision being an actual witness as they fight to protect each other, Christian from whomever wants to ruin him and Serena from a man bent on reclaiming his property.  With friends who stand by them, Ms. Evans takes you on an enjoyable ride and lets you peek into the world of the titled and wealthy.  A delightful read and I definitely recommend reading the follow up as it's a true &#34;Who done it&#34;  Only time and cunning will allow them to outwit their enemy.",4.0

7793,"The Hunt For Pierre JNRDavid M. HenleyHarper Voyager, Jul 1 2014, $16.99ISBN: 9780732295608By the middle of the twenty-second century, a small segment of the twenty billion humans residing inside the domes evolved with extrasensory mental powers.  Derogatorily dubbed psionics by those who feared their superiority will allow dominance if unchecked; the World Union established the Services with a mission to control these dangerous mutants.  The Services aggressively capture, isolate and incarcerate psionics on remote islands in order to inhibit the impact of psi skills and prevent a revolt.In 2151 an experiment mated registered Psionics Pierre Sandro and Mary Kastonovich; which leads to giving birth to Pierre Jnr.  Three months later, Pierre Jnr escapes and vanishes.  In spite of a massive manhunt by the Services, he is not found and assumed dead as he is a baby even with special kinetic skills never remotely recorded before.However, the worst nightmare of those in power surfaces in 2159 when a sighting of eight year old Pierre Jnr is confirmed by the Weave; as the legend of a psi with the uncanny ability to control others&#8217; minds lives.  The Services assigns the best psi hunters of the Primacy military wing abetted by telepath Peter Lazarus who surrendered after three decades of freedom beneath the radar to prevent the most powerful psi ever, who he believed caused his sister to suicide, from killing the world.The Hunt for Pierre Jnr is a superb science fiction thriller that extrapolates present day issues like the environment and related moral and amoral responses into the next century.  Rapidly changing points of view makes it initially difficult to follow who&#8217;s who, but also brings a fabulous frantic desperate pace to this character-driven yet action-packed futuristic thriller.Harriet Klausner",4.0

There were many characters in the intricately woven story, all juggling for attention at times making it easy to lose track of them by name.  I feel like I probably missed some of the details.  It's a good story, well worth a second read.  I believed the writing and even spent some time doing searches for anything that this might be based on.  I was almost surprised to find nothing in my searches.  Really well crafted story.Now for the less than great points.I felt like this could have been a bit better in it's pacing.  It's not always the case, but this could have probably been a bit longer.  I read a review that said the characters were clich&eacute;.  I don't think this is the case.  I think that they may have been glossed over a bit though, leading us to not fully appreciate the dimensionality of each member of the team.I haven't looked into the other books by this author or who publishes the works, etc.  but that said, I'd give this a five-star rating if there had been better editing.  Unlike many people, I do not blame authors for this at all.  When we craft a story, we must be able to hand it off to someone with less attachment, to edit and give feedback.  The spelling errors, sentence breaks, choppy areas that lose the reader a little can easily become blind spots to an author.  The writer creates a world and it's inhabitants.  They are by definition too close to look for what needs to be polished or clarified.  I would say that a revised version of this could easily be a five-star read, especially in such an affordable format.",4.0

So, if you like a page turner that is gonna keep you in suspense all night, get this book. At first, I didn't really care for the main character at all, but as she grew throughout the story, I found myself rooting for her more and more.

7811,"I bought this book in paperback ages ago and wanted a digital one to replace it. The recipes are just as great as I remember, but the digital format is a pain. Basically, the digital format is just a digital copy of the cookbook, with no helpful to each recipe. This makes finding and bookmarking the recipes horrible.Chef Paul's cookbook has lots of notations and suggestions for his dishes. In the original cookbook, he tells readers to go to page so-and-so for the Oyster Dressing, for example. Obviously, the page number technique doesn't work for Kindle but there is no digital equivalent to it, i.e. there is no link to the Oyster Dressing recipe. So you will have to type &#34;oyster dressing&#34; in search to find it. And if you're pairing the dressing with another dish, you will have to repeat this step many times. It's very frustrating and time-consuming.Final verdict: I'd recommend the recipes any day of the week but suggest you DON'T get the digital version until and if the publishers bother to add helpful links.

However she doesn't and Royce although has his secrets from her, and will do anything to protect her....the &#34;break-up&#34; wasn't horrible to read.Royce is your &#34;alpha grumpy bear&#34; and you can't help but wish you could be Lauren to experience his bossiness ;) He and his brothers own and operate a security firm and protect those who need it. Lauren works for the DA putting away the bad guys. For her doing whats right and putting the bad guys behind bars is what she lives for.

While walking his dog one morning, he meets Kasen.  A young man who is shy, and not very talkative.  Rowan also listens to the towns radio station.  There he listens to Cool Kasey, the DJ at the station.  Rowan really enjoys listening to Kasey. After offering to bring Kasey some dinner over, he finds Kasen at the station, as Kasey.  There, it all begins.  Rowan takes Kasen out of town for an early breakfast.  Just a small Waffle House, but a first for Kasen.  Rowan and Kasen's journey begins there.  Hidden thoughts and actions slowly begin between the two.This was a very touching story.  Very well written and put together nicely.  I don't usually read these kind of stories, but Tonya is my friend.  I'd read anything she has written.  Although this type of book was different for me, I learned so much about the lifestyle of two men who are attracted to each other, and the struggles they go through, just to be together.  If you're looking for hardcore sex scenes, you might want to chose a different book.  This is about tender exploring, finding someone you can be comfortable with, slowly receive feelings for, and experiencing what love feels like.  For the first time.

7825,"&#34;City of Bones&#34; had a lot of possibilities and interesting ideas, but never quite seemed to come together. Clary Fray's mother has a mysterious secret, her father is long dead, and she and her platonic male best friend are enjoying an evening out at a club when she sees a group of teens that no one else can see, and watches them murder a guy whose body disintegrates into dust. In a matter of hours, Clary's mother is missing, she is chased by demons, none of her friends are what they seem, and she is taking shelter with the Shadowhunters, a group of people with mysterious powers pledged to protect humanity from demons, monsters, vampires, werewolves, and all manner of supposedly mythic creatures. She's caught up in a war that she doesn't understand, and the more she finds out the higher the stakes get.

7836,"Mr. Hicks does know how to spin a tale. Unfortunately, the tale is stale. Firstly, the book belong more to the fantasy genre rather than to SF proper. Thus it is absolved of making any sennse in terms of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, etc. One has to accept that alien females are perfectly sexually suitable to human males. Whoah! What a relief!! The author tries to make us sympathetic to the alien culture's focus on death and cruelty. I cannot find any warmth for this idea and I wonder how Reza, the hero of the book, does almost unquestioningly.  The hero spends 40 years or so on the alien planet while a war-to-the-death is going on between the two species. Unsurprisingly (?), despite all his loved ones having been wiped out by this war, not a word is said about it. The hero and his alien love intermix their blood, but none exhibit any side effects of this strange transfusion. And so on...Moreover, the writing is rife with corny expressions that should only appear in parodies, if at all. I, for one, will not read the sequels.",2.0

7857,"Sorry if this review is analogous to a break up via text message. It's not you, it's me. I am not really your target demographic. I was curious to read your book that explored female fantasies, but they didn't interest me. I felt like I was watching one of those Twilight movies, looking around me in dismay. What was everyone getting so worked up about?So, it's not you, it's me. I am just not really responding to this at this time. I am not in the mood--or maybe I will never be in the mood. There are probably plenty of readers who would enjoy this, just not me. I remember I was in a used bookstore in Berkeley once and I overheard a coed say that she was &#34;just going to get a heavy breather and go for it.&#34; Looking around there were shelves and shelves of Harlequin Romances. Bodice rippers, I hear they are called. Fabio was on the cover of several of them. Perhaps that coed, and her many sorority sisters, would enjoy this book. Or maybe I was judging it too harshly and it was actually tantamount to Pride and Prejudice. A Jane Austen-like novel that is seemingly in the romance genre--concerned with matchmaking and gossip--but could be appreciated on a different level as an astute observation of the human condition.But I couldn't get into it. The heroine was trying to get you to sympathize with her over her lover's ex-girlfriend who had gotten pregnant and gotten back together with him. I couldn't pledge my allegiance to her. Later, there was an art auction. It was mostly about a secret society whose mission was to empower women and realize their fantasies. But I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Don't let my opinion deter you. What do I know? You might love this book. It's not you, it's me. I'm just not that into it.",3.0

Dastien is very protective of Tessa and I sometimes wished that Tessa had been more active in telling him what she was going to do. Dastien truly cares for Tessa and at times it seemed as though Tessa did not think about what her actions would do to Dastien (they are true bound mates after all). Whatever Dastien felt throughout the book usually was a result of what Tessa was going through or about to do. I also was not that happy with Tessa, she was constantly not wanting to shift into a wolf because she did not want to lose the last of her humanity. Well if your going to be with Dastien who is a wolf himself then you kind of have to accept the fact that your a wolf. Overall it was a good novella.",3.0

In a taut narrative, enlivened by anecdotes, everyone - well, almost everyone - who mattered makes an appearance.  Freud, Stalin, Hitler, Saul Bellow and a galaxy of luminaries.  You get a strong sense of the flow of the century.  A great story of Reich's childhood tragedy that he never could overcome.It's a big fat book, but such a page turner that I was glad to read to the last page.  What Reich was planning to do for the rest of his life just prior to his death in a federal prison came as a heart-warming surprise.The author is a journalist, not a psychiatrist, but he 'gets' what happened in psychiatry better than many of my professional colleagues.

The writing could be horrible but I'd keep turning pages just to see what amazing aviation and military inventions show up next. The thing is, the writing is as competent as the cover art. That's an understatement. I will review this novel for the August issue of Perihelion Science Fiction, along with information I'll pillage from the author's website. Charles A. Cornell has given waaay more thought to steam punk, diesel punk, and punk culture in general, than I have. Click on his name under the title of this book and visit his author page, twitter, facebook and web pages. What a world! People lament that the Golden Age of Science Fiction is dead. They are wrong. It has simply changed, as all progressive thinking and imagining should.Buy this book, if only for the illustrations, but also with the bonus of a great story with great characters. The Nazi villains are horrifying and I hate to read of their cruelty, but that part, sadly, is historically accurate. The Dragonfly, also sadly, is not historical, but imagined. The way great things appear in sci-fi first, then in real life, hey, who knows? Water-fueled aircraft may be in our future!Rare, oh, rare indeed, is the book that has me so enthralled and so eager to promote a new genre. Steampunk goes back only to 1987. Dieselpunk is even newer than that. I hadn't even heard of it until this year. I hope that means most other people haven't heard of it, either (I do hate being the last one to the party).I LOVE THIS NOVEL!More to come at the Perihelion ezine.",5.0

Having an electrical fire start in her master bedroom leaves her shell shocked and in tears because those same photos were stored in a keepsake box in her bedroom and a major loss in the fire.Firefighter Gavin Morgan fights fires for a living and never has he had a reaction to a victim as intense as the one he felt the day Abby took comfort in his arms.Gavin has spent over two weeks since the fire where he met Abby thinking about her and it is driving him a little crazy because he has never been obsessive over a woman in the past, he comes up with a plan to get her out of his system and when his invitation is accepted by Abby he finds himself unable to carry out his anonymous seduction. Abby is humiliated and leaves in tears.The way the author manages to bring Abby and Gavin together after their disastrous second meeting is both honest and sweet, the way in which things work out between the pair however is sinfully sexy and a fitting ending to a very emotional story.As a whole this anthology epitomizes everything we all fantasize about and yearn for, someone who can be both a source of strength and comfort as well as someone who can make us burn out of control with a single touch or look. If you are in the mood for stories of strong men and women exploring their attraction to each other as well as bonding on an emotional level than these erotic tales are going to be just the ticket for warming you up!It is truly hard to say that any of the novellas are a favorite, each couples story brings something enjoyable as each author created their own unique contemporary romance with the perfect blend of sweet emotional connections along with flaming hot chemistry that burns brighter than any flames from one of the fires that these male heroes fight for a living![EArc from Netgalley in exchange for honest review]",5.0

7888,"I've read a lot of Koontz novels, but this one strayed a bit from his usual style of horror and suspense. Though disappointing at times when authors do that, Innocence wasn't at all. This just may be one of Koontz's best novels to date, and it could possibly be his masterpiece as well. A story of sadness, loss, suffering, love and hatred, it's also clearly a tale about beauty being more than skin deep. Koontz hits on some deeply profound subject matter in this mysterious and suspenseful story. Both Addison and Gwyneth were amazingly lovable characters. I enjoyed this book immensely.",5.0
7889,"Twenty-two year old Rose Adams and her twenty-one-year-old sister, Ivy, experience the shock of their lives when their father dies unexpectedly leaving them orphaned, homeless, and penniless. It&#8217;s 1925, and up until then, the girls have been living in modest luxury in their attractive family home, Adams House, in the country town of Forest Grove, in upstate New York. Soon, the family&#8217;s solicitor explains to the sisters that not only was their father&#8217;s finances in ruin, but he&#8217;d been harboring an incredible secret: the girls had a older half-brother named Asher&#8230;and the family home has been willed exclusively to him. Evidently, their father had been trying to locate Asher for quite some time, but had failed. Now it was up to the two sisters to find him. The only clue they have is a photograph of Asher in front of a boarding house in New York City.Soon the sisters pack up what belongings they can carry and take the train to New York City. They arrive &#8220;like a pair of unexploded bombs.&#8221; It&#8217;s not hard for them to locate the boarding house in Greenwich Village that was in the background of Asher&#8217;s photograph. They need to learn more about their brother&#8217;s connection to this place, so they secure inexpensive attic accommodations and start questioning the boarders. Everyone says they&#8217;ve never seen him, but the sisters sense that they are all hiding something. There is an air of mystery over everything and everybody. Soon they&#8217;ve completely adapted to the crazy life of the boarding house. It is a fun place filled with rowdy, lively, bathtub-gin-loving modern women. There are also two nice-looking guys associated with the place who instantly move in on the sisters in a sweet romantic way.The book recreates what it might have been like for two young woman to be set free in The Big City during the Roaring Twenties&#8212;an era filled as much with jazz clubs, speakeasies, flappers, and bobs, as it was with enormous social, artistic, and cultural upheaval. The book does a very good job of putting the reader smack in middle of that exciting and tumultuous world&#8230;and that is exactly what I enjoyed most about this book.On the slightly negative side, the book dragged a bit in parts, especially in the beginning. However, eventually I got into the rhythm of the plot and it carried me along nicely right up to the gratifying ending. The characters, although somewhat stereotypical, were far better than I expected.Basically, it was one terrific story. It&#8217;s been a few days since I finished reading the book and the mental image of the two sisters and the story of what happened to them still tumbles around in my mind, giving me pleasure.For me, &#8220;Empire Girls&#8221; was a delightful, breezy, uplifting, family-oriented story with a touch of honest romance. It&#8217;s a book about relationships of all kinds: how important they are and how difficult it is to not be misunderstood by those who mean the most to you. And what&#8217;s not to like about that? I&#8217;d say, it&#8217;s a great choice to put on your light summer reading list.",4.0

7893,I found this book particularly helpful. There are many great ideas to improve and keep your brain healthy. This book covers everything from types of food that contain anti-oxidants to prevent free radicals from affecting your brain (and your body) to exercises in the form of games which help to build your brain like a muscle.The best part of these &#34;secrets&#34; is that they are not a burden to do.

I found this book to be different than some of the same ideas I hear time and again on personal improvement.,5.0

But when one of your favorite horror writers comes with a romantic comedy, well, who can really resist that. Mostly, I guess it would be curiosity. Just wanted to see what he can come up with. And I will tell you this, this is good. No doubt about it. If you're familar with Jeff Strand's work then you already have an idea what you're in for. He still writes with his same witty humor and fast paced style. Chances are you may be like me and vowed to never read romance, but don't miss out on this one. You're gonna love it. I promise.",5.0

However, the strategy can be quite complex and that keeps it interesting. First you build roads, then towns and cities. To build you need materials. Getting those materials can be tricky and a lot depends on how strategically you placed your initial game pieces. You can gather an army, too. It is competitive, challenging and completely addicting. When our adult children come for a visit we play Settlers of Catan and Monty Python Fluxx. Highly recommend this game.",5.0

7902,"This is one of those instances where I found that I quite enjoyed the prose, but didn't care much for the story.Finian was far and away the most endearing character, though I have to wonder if this has more to do with the brevity of the text--the book is only 160 pages long--than anything else. Corin/na was a take-charge kind of girl, and I give points for that, but I had a hard time really caring about her. More interesting to me was the world in which fae and selkie existed as a matter of course rather than curiosity.Billingsley's words flow in such a way that the book felt like a song. I felt like I was caught in a piece of music rather than a narrative, with its requisite ups and downs, fermatas and staccato phrases. She mentioned in the biography on the back flap that her Scottish father used to sing to her and her siblings each night, and I think that has something to do with it.As a writer, I wouldn't mind if some of that skill with prose wore off on me, but the story itself felt rushed.

He basically talks about the same things over and over again. And most of the info in here I was already familiar with from reading Valis and the other late period novels. I can't imagine having to read all 9000 pages of the Exegesis, the 900 pages printed in this book were quite enough.

Unbeloved takes place seven years after Dorothy was shot. She has moved away from the club and only has minimal interaction with them when she has to.It takes a terrible event to set everything in motion for Hawk and Dorothy to be together.

7914,"I received the Kindle version of this book to read and review. I have not completed the book but from what I read so far, the author is absolutely correct.She talks about your biological age and your chronological age. There is also a test you can take to determine your results. Do not be surprised if your biological age is much older than your chronological age.There is a lot of information about the hidden sugars in our diet and she talks about the foods that help keep your blood sugar stabilized. She talks about Stevia and other artificial sweeteners. Also, expect to get a short lesson on gluten-free diets.The only thing I disliked about this book is that the chapters are labeled as Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and so on, instead of being labeled by the contents they contain. Also, I wish she would have talked about Yacon, a natural root sweetener.",5.0
7915,"I was super excited to read this book. The cover is gorgeous and the blurb sounds really interesting. At first, it was everything I had been hoping for. Laurel is writing letters to dead celebrities as she tries to figure out her life. She is trying to cope with the fact that her mom ran away and her sister died. She's at a new school and makes some new friends. The writing is gorgeous and full of emotion. I love the way Laurel describes things, like the way she feels connected to the music of dead singers, or the performances of dead actors.About half way through, I started to lose interest. The beginning was so awesome, but then the same things kept getting rehashed over and over. The writing was still beautiful, and I really enjoyed Laurel's relationship with the dead people she keeps writing to. But the story had somehow lost it's spark for me. I didn't feel like I connected with the characters all that much. They were all pretty quirky, which isn't a bad thing, but it just wasn't MY thing.I'm not a teenager, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I can't be certain that I would have connected with the book even if I were a teenager. I'm chalking this one up to personal taste, because it really is a beautifully written book.Content: This one has a LOT of content. Underage drinking, sex between underage teens and older guys, drugs, smoking, passionate make out sessions with and without clothes, and quite a bit of language. Far too many F-words for my tastes.The Cover: I adore this cover! It is so gorgeous and it portrays the feel of this book really well. The cover was definitely a huge plus for me.",3.0
7916,"Continuing to struggle with this series....I love the concept of bad boy loves good girl but this is crazy and the cliches keep coming and the the factual errors are still there and the serious editing problems have not been addressed. I've read almost all of the books in the series so there is something there but the editing and the trite dialogue and the mushy way the cowboys talk sort of kills it. Incorrect names, changes in character descriptions, commas in the wrong place or not at all, and the cheesy dialogue were nearly too much, but I'm not a quitter and I saw something there too bad it never quite reached the good point. I can't recommend the series at the individual price of $4.99 per book. The glaring errors literally ripped me out of the story time and time again. I'd recommend finding an editor, perhaps a beta team that has medical, BDSM, and other qualified people in it to help the author get the facts straight, and lower the price to .99 cents. $5 is just way too much. I won't be buying anymore in the series...I just can't torture myself any further.",2.0

7928,"The Basics:This is a tough one to describe without giving too much away, so bear with me. Eleanor is trying to slip through life unnoticed. Apart from her less earthly reasons, she and her terminally ill mother, and only confidante, are on public assistance, terrified of being separated by social services. As her mother's condition deteriorates and David, the only friend Eleanor has ever had, returns to town, she has to decide whether to open up and build a real life, or run away as she always has.The Downside:Um... let's see... well, David is the boyfriend every girl should dream of, and his patience with Eleanor is incredibly sweet, but just for the sake of giving him a bit more credit as someone in love rather than someone possibly addicted to abuse, she could be a bit less horrible to him at a few points when she&#8217;s less consciously trying to drive him away. And when Eleanor really starts to use what she is, maybe the chain of events could have been a little simpler. One plan gone awry fewer. Maybe.This section was hard to fill. It's a really, really good book.The Upside:Eleanor. The book and the character. It's pretty much all upside. The character of Eleanor is written with the depth and absence of condescension I always hope for in female leads but so rarely find, even from female authors. She loves deeply but is more than her love. She&#8217;s heroic yet vulnerable. The nature of what she is (which I shall not spoil) seamlessly influences the way she thinks and sees the world, making her distinctive and memorable.Eleanor isn't all that's vividly realized, either. For example, there's a part in which two characters in the same place at the same time are referred to by the same name for reasons I can't go into without spoilers. There are hardly any extra words used to specify which one is meant in each instance, and yet the whole sequence is far less confusing than this sentence describing it, because everything is so crisply described and the characters so identifiable by more than name or appearance.The magic is well integrated into the world, without taking over the whole story. The quite grounded drama surrounding the viciousness of the rumor mill, especially its treatment of girls, is cutting, insightful, and painfully relatable. The romance, rocky as Eleanor's struggle makes it, has a beautiful earnestness to it, and no matter how twisting and turning the final act, I was very sorry to see it end.",5.0

The story is built around the relationships formed to help Callie and Kayden deal with the demons that stalk them and control their life's and how they grow through these issues. How the issues affect them and their friends and family members. I couldn't put this book down and immediately bought the sequel, Redemption of Callie and Kayden, to find out where it all ended. Thanks Jessica for writing about domestic abuse issues, so well, and how some learn to resolve and cope. Cheers Kerrie",5.0

7958,"This is not an easy book to categorize.  At best I would say that it's a fantasy alternate history.  Much of the story seems to follow a type of Stalinist style government with a vicious KGB service.  The major difference in this 'world' is that magic/supernatural still occurs.  More than this as a plot is hard to summarize.The major protagonist is a man named Lom (translates as 'scrap',who has an uncertain paternity).  He lives in the province that mirrors Siberia.  He is an 'investigator' for the secret service.  He has been called to the capital Mirgorod (which can be translated as universe or kingdom and was ordered built in a swampland (think St.Petersberg) by the Founder who could be Peter the Great) by an underminister.  He wants Lom to investigate the head of the secret service Lavrentia Chazia (Lavrenti Beria was Stalin's last head of the KGB).[Note: if you use a Russian-English translator on some of the names, you get a better idea as to what Higgins is trying to relate the characters to.]Lom, of course, gets involved in trying to counter a plot to bring down the Novozhd by his secret service.  The plots can be very convoluted and the supernatural becomes the major help/mover of what will happen.  The trouble is that there are so many agendas among the characters that it's hard to keep them straight.There is no question that this is the beginning of a series.  The ending of this book has set-up a whole series of unfinished business that will have to be resolved and we can guess who will have to do it.  A series well worth continuing to read.Zeb Kantrowitz",3.0

7961,"There&#8217;s always a risk when it comes to falling in love with an author&#8217;s book.The big question is how on earth will their next story top it?Before I even opened Insipid, my expectations were really high. The gorgeous cover, the intriguing title, the captivating blurb and an interesting prologue that will make you crave for answers. Christine Brae&#8217;s previous books have been on top of my list for 2013 great reads, but could she do it again?&#34;Closing Doors. Is that what my life has been about? Is that why I am now doing the complete opposite? Opening them. Rebelling against life's best plaid plans? Living with the need to break free? But what is it that I'm running away from? What am I searching for?&#34;And for the 3rd time around, Christine Brae did not disappoint. Insipid has all the elements I like about her books. The romance, the challenging friendships and the integration of family life. The importance of these situations were balanced so nicely with delightful details and endings you wouldn&#8217;t have completely expected. The book is very organized and was very sure of its own identity even until the very end.Insipid is a great story of two people who need and seek isolation so that they may heal their old wounds but serendipitously end up falling love with each other. I really rooted for these two as I warmed up to both of them. It is beautiful!This story starts out with a great deal of sadness. Two young lovers looking forward to the rest of their lives crash and burn due to social status and differences. Jade, with a very sheltered life, and Chris struggling to have a successful career in basketball but never really had the chance to fulfill it. There are many flashbacks to the young couple&#8217;s fresh and vibrant life together which intermixed very well with the kind of life they had after the fall out. Much to my surprise and delight, there is a fascinating and intriguing mystery that kind of turns the story upside-down.Trying to move on with her bitter past, Jade, tries to live a normal life. Dedicating most of her time to her career, where she met the man who unexpectedly brought back the color in her life, Lucas.Despite of what he has become, Lucas did some stupid things in the past when the last girl almost broke him in more ways than one. But something happens that brings about an enormous change in his life. Lucas is determined to get closer to Jade, though the path to get there ain&#8217;t easy, he has the patience and strong will to stick it out. Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that he finds Jade so mysterious. Maybe because he sees her as someone so strong yet so breakable. Maybe because he feels that Jade needs him, and Lucas needs to be needed. Whatever it is, I loved watching their romance develop slowly.Insipid is a very quiet, gentle story that perfectly reflects not only Lucas and Jade&#8217;s characters but their slow struggle back toward life. There are many unforeseen obstacles with which they have to deal with, but in the end, truth and love prevail. It&#8217;s about hope and forgiveness. A loving story that truly allows two people who have been shattered for somewhat different reasons to heal, to blend, and to meld beautifully. Fantastic!&#34;The past. Sometimes, we get so hung up about it that it prevents us from looking ahead.Let the past go. Step forward no matter how much more comfortable you are with your past.Trust in your heart because it places its trust in you.&#34;If you like to read books with an emotional, meaningful story, with lots of character growth, twists and turns, and important life lessons, then give this one a go!Thanks to Ms. Brae for letting me be part of Lucas and Jade's journey. I am eagerly looking forward to read and experience your next book. 4 stars",4.0

7963,I gave this book two stars because the characters and the plot were not fully developed. I think most of the material was rushed and the content was too graphic. I almost stopped reading at the child molestation part and after the rape scene it was too much. This was more for shock value. I think this author has potential to be good.

7965,"I received a free ecopy of this book for an honest review.Dancing Backward in Paradise is the story of Grace Place who&#8217;s in her early twenties.  She falls in love for the first time but her mom wants her to go to New York City to become an actress as soon as she has enough money. Grace plans on going to New York just to make her mom happy.I liked Grace because she is good hearted and she tries to do the right thing. It was hard for me to believe that anyone could be as naive as Grace.This is a good story with a lot of unique characters and drama with many twists and turns. It was predictable at times and a little frustrating when Grace was surprised about things that were so obvious. There is a lot of unnecessary cussing in this book. If that doesn&#8217;t bother you, then I recommend Dancing Backward in Paradise.",4.0
7966,"There are so many fitness weight training books out there.While this is another one, it is as good as any others are.In fact i have seen many not as good.this book is definitely written more for a beginner, which is good, but has enough knowledge that even a veteran can appreciate.I like that it breaks it down into 3 main areas.muscle toning, body shaping, and strength with 75 programs with 6 week color coded workout zones,and 63 most popular exercises.I do feel this is made more for people that use machines at a gym.I think free weights can do a better job myself and more convenient. Thats just my opinion.In this new age of gym rats, this is a good starting book.Most people will need a trainer to get the results you want unless you have the will to push yourself on your own.In any case its nice reading and well written and better than most books out there.",4.0

7968,"This book is a companion to Johnson's Caldecott Honor book, ""Alphabet City"", although it is a bit darker and more somber. Johnson has created photo-realistic paintings of New York City scenes that feature the numerals one through twenty-one, with some, (like the Figure 8 on the cover), being obvious and some, (like a number 6 created from cogs, gears and shadows), resembling those figures used in eye/brain recognition tests.My first encounter with this book was when my five year old grandson pulled it from its shelf at the Children's Library. He plopped down on the floor and I plopped down right next to him and we poured over the paintings. Once we figured out the pictures were in order from one to twenty-one, and that there weren't going to be any words, we went to town playing number search. He got a lot of them on his own, and enjoyed getting the rest with some hints and suggestions. We both had a good time, and it was very rewarding to watch the little kid gears turning in his head as he searched the paintings.Of course, this is all about shapes and numbers, but as Kirkus noted, it is also about visual literacy. We talked about photo-realist painting and about composition. And we had fun.So, this is a game, a sophisticated introduction to composition, a bit of art instruction, and an all around happy book experience.",5.0

7971,"This is definitely not the usual type of happy-fluffy Amish fiction that you might expect and I was very pleasantly surprised. The story is riveting, the characters are compelling and there is such strong, raw emotion woven through it, that I found myself dearly wishing for a sequel, because I wanted to know more about what would happen to Leah and her family and Jacob. I will admit that I read this entire tale in a single sitting, because I couldn't wait to find out more about Leah and I was surprised at some of the realities showed about Amish life and culture.For the story, the premise is quite simple, but the story itself is delightfully complicated. The Main character, Leah Rader, is struggling with some personal questions that seem to be conflicting with her Old Order Amish faith. Instead of chasing after superficial things, trinkets or Englisher ways, Leah's &#34;rebellion&#34; isn't really a rebellion at all--she's searching for truth, something to truly believe in, with her heart and soul. Reading along with Leah as she discovers the differences between &#34;religion&#34; and &#34;faith&#34; was very thought-provoking. Definitely a worthwhile read, ending on a hopeful note--even as Leah's bittersweet tale gently pokes your heart in all the right places.",5.0

I just might need to call the fire department to pay me, I mean my house a visit, just to make sure my fire....I MEAN this house fire is put out. Do you think a Smith or three might show up at my door?!In all seriousness, I love books where there is a friends to lovers storyline. It is probably my favorite kind because of all the pent up sexual tension that has been smoldering. Jamie and Smith did NOT disappoint when it comes to the heat at all!Jamie is not interested in going there with Smith. Or so she keeps telling herself, nevermind all the feelings that rush through her whenever he is around. But despite those tingling sensations that are getting harder to ignore, she has seen how the whole friends to lovers thing plays out when things go south. And she values her friendship with Smith too much to put her true feelings for him on the line. Especially considering there is no way he feels the same way about her, right?Oh, how blind that poor girl is!Smith is feeling the exact same way Jamie is, right down to thinking he is the only one that has feelings for the other. And one night, when he finally sees that maybe it isn't so one-sided after all, he pounces. I am surprised their &#34;encounter&#34; that night didn't burn the building down, it was that HOT!But did crossing that line create a recipe for disaster? Is it possible that Jamie and Smith could work as more than friends despite all their differences? Or will they be another failed attempt of a friends to lovers romance? Well, you just have to read Burn For Me to see how things play out for these two! And believe me when I say, you don't want to miss a minute of their story.",5.0

How anyone can be so cruel is unfathomable to me.  And for him to be released from prison on these horrific crimes previously is unconscionable.  Is it really worth believing someone that is so sick in the head that he is reformed and let him go back into the communities and reoffend?  I don't think so.  The victims wife's determination to do what she felt she had to do to alert the communities and the law to sentence him to a long sentence and to keep him in prison is admirable.  She never gave up...thumbs up for her.",5.0

7976,"Did someone say no holds barred? In Perception Xander Boone is a force. His massive physical size is only out done by the size of his heart and his capacity to love. His touch is exquisite, his desire intense. He is drawn to a woman&#8217;s inner strength, captivated by her intelligence and wit. Not just any woman. No, Xander has been drawn, for almost a decade, to Mercedes Bryant. And she to him. However, they both perceived themselves as Dominants. Lived their lives as such, never giving in to more than just a strong friendship. That is, until an opportunity arose that Xander couldn&#8217;t pass up. Putting his plan in motion and slowly laying all his cards on the table, he left Mercedes to reevaluate her perception of the past, the present and the possibility of a future. I couldn't wait to see what was going to play out. Both in and outside of the playroom. I was not disappointed in the least.I love Nicole&#8217;s characters. Xander and Mercedes, along with Shane, Clarissa, and Xander&#8217;s parents are fantastic. You get enough of their history to tie the binds, but the intense, fast paced writing allows the reader to stay in the moment. To experience the sensations and emotions. I very much appreciated the exploration of trust, pleasing your partner, honesty, connecting and love. The push and pull of their power struggle. The idea of altering your perception. The only thing that I find myself wondering as I&#8217;ve reached the end of the book is why sometimes the Dom~sub relationship is structured and sometimes they are just two people in love.  Did the story alter my perception or was that the whole point? That, in fact they moved away from the roles and just were. Undefined. Perception was a great read.The Club Destiny series continues to be surprising, arousing and ultimately offers something special for every type of erotic and romantic reader.",4.0

7979,"I think it is important to understand that when you're reading romance-y historical fiction, you aren't necessarily going to get a book that is historically accurate. So I try not to take accuracy into account when deciding how much I liked a historical fiction book. At first I was a little bit annoyed with the constant switching of points of view in this novel, but I got used to it as it went on. I definitely enjoyed Anne and Katherine's chapters more than Jane's, but I understand why the author included Jane's POV. Part of the reason I enjoyed this book was definitely that I find Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard to be the most interesting of Henry's wive, and Anne is my favorite of the 6 wives. I liked that the author tried to make Katherine sympathetic, because she is often presented as a bit of a slut, for lack of a better word, but she was only 21 when she died (although the book ages her down to be 16), so one can't really blame her for cheating on her ill, 50 year old husband with a man her own age.",4.0

7983,"This is apparently Italy's answer to &#34;Fifty Shades of Whatever&#34; (which I have not read) - and it delivers a tame story but some genuinely sensual pages. As literature it's not worth much. But it does carry an erotic charge.Elena, a shy, restorer who is both a vegetarian and a teetotaler and who wears dowdy clothes without makeup (symbols of her repressed state) is working to bring new life to a faded fresco in a Venetian palazzo owned by a count. Incidentally, the Venetian backdrop to this tale does increase its allure and interest.Elena's profession is a not very subtle clue about the state of her own spirit. She is literally awakening the old colors with vibrant new ones. But, standing on a ladder, removed from earth, she experiences the world only with her eyes. She needs someone to force her other senses to awaken. As she brings the fresco back to life, who will do the same to Elena herself?Elena does have a male friend, Filippo, who is just as shy as she is - and perhaps both of them would like the relationship to become more than friendship if only they had the guts to act on their feelings. Eventually they pluck up courage, but then Filippo relocates to Rome before the love affair can develop.This leaves the field clear for celebrity chef Leonardo, who arrives to open a new restaurant in Venice. Soon Elena is literally eating from his hand. He offers sex pure and simple. He's in charge. Her choice is to accept what he is able to give without question. What he gives are a series of shuddering orgasms - but the man sleeps around, disappears for days or weeks on end and to say he has commitment issues is an understatement.We follow Elena through her awakening. The sex scenes have a kind of sweet old-fashioned tone to them. The descriptions are detailed but somehow not too clinical or specific. We don't get a complete play-by-play -- which is a good thing. So much romance writing delves into the micro-details and ends up being cold and impersonal. Here, for some reason, there remains a gauze of mystery even when the writing is very explicit. I also enjoyed the terminology -- &#34;he placed his sex in mine.&#34; no f word, no c word. It's kind of old-fashioned but sexier for that.The story meanders to its preordained conclusion in a rather unsatisfactory way. I understand this is part one of a trilogy and I don't have the need to read the other installments. Still, not a total washout.",3.0

7986,"Four out of Five FangsI received a copy of this story for an honest review for Paranormal Romance and Authors that Rock!Sleeping Gods picks up months after renegade angel Cole abandons his great love Lexi in Lunangelique, the newly identified offspring of Moon Goddess Selene and warrior angel Edmund. Cole&#8217;s desertion coupled with the pressure of fulfilling the prophecy of awakening the sleeping ancient Gods trapped by Sun God Helios, crush Lexi and make her a ghost of her former self.&#8220;With every second that goes by, my anger and hurt for Cole leaving me turns into hate. I hate that he was a coward, I hate that it was so easy for him to leave me, I hate that he let my father drive him away, I hate that he has not once tried to contact me, I hate that he hurt me.&#8221;As Lexi turns to angel Patryck for comfort and support on her quest she doesn&#8217;t realize Cole is watching from the shadows. Cole left with the idea of protecting Lexi from the taint of his past but watching her slowly fall for Patryck drives him to the brink of insanity. When Cole reinserts himself in Lexi&#8217;s life and journey to awaken the God&#8217;s, she all but screams her displeasure.&#8220;Man, does it suck when someone you love everything about, hates something about you.&#8221;Sleeping Gods is an exciting and adventurous follow-up to Lunangelique. Author Kristin Campbell does a great job of balancing Lexi and crew&#8217;s epic quest to release the Gods with the mandatory angsty YA love triangle. Lexi&#8217;s heartbreak and Cole&#8217;s desperation give the two characters a little harder edge that match the sense of urgency in finding Lexi&#8217;s Goddess mother Selene and the other Gods locked away from the rest of the world. The introduction of new demi-gods and other ancient legends add new life to the story and getting both Lexi and Cole&#8217;s POV&#8217;s made the story richer.The one tiny complaint I have involves a member of the Lexi-Patryck-Cole love triangle. We as readers get to know fairly quickly in the story that one member of the triangle is a bad person with bad intentions. Lexi stays oblivious for the majority of the story. With her new Goddess/Angel powers she cannot tell she&#8217;s being lied to. Her super powerful Angel father and God/Angel brother cannot tell she&#8217;s being lied to. Only the other member of the triangle knows and he says nothing. I actually caught myself yelling at my Kindle &#8220;Just tell her already!&#8221;Overall Sleeping Gods is a great story full of energy, interesting lore, and well developed characters. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a great next step in the Lunangelique trilogy.",4.0
7987,"T.H. Snyder did it again!!!  I have been waiting for this book since I read Cursed Love.  That is where I fell in love with Dault.Cursed Ecstasy picks up where Cursed Love left off.  Dault has to learn to deal with his past before he can move on to his future, and Etty has to decide if Dault is worth waiting for or if she should just move on.I loved this book.  It took me on one heck of  an emotional ride.  I fell in love with Dault even more. It was so great to get to know him and learn all his different layers.  Dault is a very complicated character.  While I have always been team Dault there were a few times that I wanted to slap him but as the story goes on and more details are released about the things he has been through the more the reader can understand what makes him the person he is.I was unsure about Etty during Cursed Love but I fell in love with her too!  Getting to know both of these characters on a deeper level was far more emotional then I thought it was going to be.  I was crying for the first time by chapter 3 and I cried a few other times as well.  I spent a lot of this heart broken for both characters, but when things got good they were really good and had me saying aww out loud. There were also times that I wanted to hit something and throw things(  I may or may not have thrown my e-reader) .  You also get to see some of Linc in this book and at times he made me angry but I still love him.T.H.

7988,"Simon&#8217;s &#8220;Leaders Eat Last&#8221; takes the commitment of leadership to the next level.  In his analysis Simon delves into the sociology of individuals, groups, teams, and tribes.  The results are profound; we are biologically predisposed to collaborate with one another.  The safer we feel in our tribe or team, the more effective we will be in serving our organization.  So what differentiates those teams that provide a safe environment and those that don&#8217;t?  Leadership is the difference&#8230;and not just any style of leadership but selfless leadership across all levels of an organization.  Simon does an excellent job building a foundation of why we are meant to work together, he provides examples throughout his book of selfless leadership, and he motivates the reader to action.  Now more than ever our culture must understand the necessity of our bonds to each other and why it is necessary to serve a purpose greater than ourselves.  Simon provides the tools in &#8221;Leaders Eat Last&#8221; for a team to evolve from being effective to being exceptional.",5.0

7990,"Author Kate Deveaux has done it again! She easily drew me into the sexy erotic romance tale about lost love found and second chances that kept me turning the pages and wanting more!Academy Of Love follows the steamy love story of Cassianna Baxter and Lawrence Taylor. Cassianna returns to her alma mater, the all-girls boarding school Lewiston Academy, as the new Deputy Head Mistress. Twelve years ago as a student, Cassianna had a whirlwind affair with Lawrence, who was the equestrian riding instructor. But when Lawrence suddenly leaves the boarding school, he took Cassianna's heart, leaving her devastated. When Cassianna returns to the boarding school twelve years later, she literally bumps into Lawrence who is now an academy board member. Can Cassianna remain professional while the old flame smolders for her first love, a man she couldn't forget? Can lost love be found and given a second chance?Oh my goodness, this is one heck of a sexy story that has a little bit of everything that I look for in an erotic romance novel. It has naughtiness, passion, steamy sexual chemistry, angst, and a satisfying second chance at love interwoven within a well written description of the past and present dynamic of Cassianna and Lawrence's relationship. The storyline easy drew me into Cassianna and Lawrence's story, their relationship comes full circle as they discover that time and distance couldn't quell the desire and love that they still have for each. Their chemistry is palpable, their desire and love undeniable, and their passion is simply sigh worthy, even other people and communication issues can't keep them from finding their way back into each other's arms. Don't be misled by the racy book cover, this sassy erotic romance doesn't have a BDSM theme, but it sure does make you curious to look between the covers now doesn't it?!Academy Of Love is a well written and fast paced erotic romance story. It has richly detailed descriptions of the setting; realistic and flawed characters who are easy to relate to; witty dialogue and dramatic interactions; and a delightful romantic storyline about an undeniable love connection that was thoroughly enjoyable and left a satisfied smile on my face.",4.0
7991,"There's so much room for fun when you've got a guy and a girl trying to play matchmaker for each other! You end up with scenes like this one, which occurs during the first date Troy sets up for Erin:&#8220;I should probably let you two have dinner alone,&#8221; Troy said. He started to stand.Without thinking, Erin pressed her hand to his thigh to keep him right where he was. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly. You drove all this way, you should stay and eat, too.&#8221;&#8220;I should?&#8221; Surprise and indecision were etched around his eyes.&#8220;Please,&#8221; she said, not lifting her hand. Bryce seemed nice enough, but there were no sparks. No flutters. She&#8217;d give him a chance, but would rather have Troy at her side when she did it.&#8220;Uh, well, they do serve a mean fettuccine Bolognese.&#8221;&#8220;I love fettuccine Bolognese.&#8221; She glanced up at the waitress. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have that, too, please. Bryce?&#8221;Bryce looked a little flummoxed. &#8220;The eggplant Parmesan.&#8221;Troy leaned over so his breath tickled the side of her neck. &#8220;He&#8217;s a vegetarian,&#8221; he whispered.Erin lifted her shoulder to her ear.&#8220;And while my leg is quite happy to hold your hand, I got the message.&#8221;She discreetly pulled her arm back and hoped her cheeks weren&#8217;t turning red. Troy made her forget herself. He scattered her brain cells in a most uninvited way.It was time to focus her attention on her date, Bryan. Bryce. She meant Bryce.LOL!It was nice finally seeing Erin have a HEA--she spent the first two books sitting on the sidelines, cheering on her two closest friends as they find love. Sela and Kagan are both back in book three, helping Erin to get a clue this time. (Because, really. Having a hot, single paramedic be your wingman? Please. Such a waste. Obviously you should be giving the guy a different job!)Troy is a fantastic hero. Not only does he have a drool-worthy uniform, but he's got an absolutely adorable relationship with his four-year-old niece. Who doesn't love to see that? He tries to find Erin a date, really he does--and not just because doing so will get him out of grocery duty for two months. He's genuinely a nice guy who wants to help people, all people, whenever he can.Too bad he's also pretty clueless. I mean seriously, dude--when you can't stop gazing into her eyes and getting distracted by thoughts of what you want to do to her? You're probably not going to be terribly successful finding her someone else. Or be terribly satisfied with the result if you actually do find her someone else.Luckily for Troy, he has a (slightly) older (twin) sister to help set him straight on that score. ;)I loved that Erin--the daredevil extraordinaire--is afraid of her own blood. It made for some cute scenes where she needed to be &#34;rescued&#34; (not that she's a damsel in need of rescuing, of course not!) by a hot paramedic. And his trusty four-year-old sidekick, in one instance. Did I mention, absolutely adorable?And speaking of adorable--the scene where Troy convinces Erin that they should be together is sigh-worthy. And it doesn't hurt that her older brother Luke (yep--he's back too!) has a behind-the-scenes hand in it as well.Robin Bielman's got plenty of room for more books in this series--yay! The youngest Watters sibling, Teague, suffers a romantic disaster in this one and so obviously needs her own happy ending. Troy's work buddy Oliver (the lucky guy who ends up not having to suffer undue ogling at the grocery store for two months) clearly could use a HEA as well. It would be nice to see Bree, Troy's widowed sister find love a second time, and.... See? Plenty of chances to revisit Cascade in the future. And I'll be there for them all, believe me.Want to come along? :)Rating: 4 stars/ BI received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.",4.0

7993,"Although there are too many subplots in this book, I adore it. I&#8217;ve been very interested in Jonathan since reading about him in the second book of this series, TO KISS A TEXAN. In it, Jonathan has just been brought back from the Apache&#8217;s to live and he&#8217;s not happy. He rages and just wants to return to the Apache.Now it is 10 years later and Jonathan doesn&#8217;t feel he lives any better in his world, but understands he cannot return to the old ways (the Apache are being placed on reservations). He&#8217;s inherited a sprawling ranch from his grandmother but has one year to show a profit before it will finally be his.Jonathan only sees the property as a means to return to his wandering around the world; he plans to get it on its feet and sell it &#8211; giving him funds to continue wandering. One of his main problems is that no one at the ranch has a head for figures &#8211; he&#8217;s in Kansas City to hire a bookkeeper.Kara O&#8217;Riley has recently graduated from bookkeeping school and is looking for a position. Kara&#8217;s father sent her off to study because things were getting more violent at the mines and he feared for his only-child&#8217;s safety. He told her not to contact him for at least 3 months and then to contact him indirectly.Jonathan&#8217;s lawyer hires Kara but she and Jonathan have problems immediately. Kara is used to touching people while talking with them and Jonathan doesn&#8217;t like to be touched. He has lived alone for a long time and thinks he doesn&#8217;t want to change. However, Kara is a unique character who gets under his skin.At times, this story is hilarious (the &#8216;wee little bookkeeper.&#8217;) and sometimes Jonathan&#8217;s insights are sad and prophetic.

7996,"This book gives you the impression that you are being dropped right in the middle of an ongoing story and that you need to have read previous stories to understand what they are referring to; however they are doing her origin story in flashbacks interspersed throughout the book. To be honest this is a better way of doing it, she is not a super hero and thus does not suddenly acquire her powers and go off and have wonderful adventures; she is a long time, battle hardened character who is very different in her finished state to how she is when she first starts out. This way we get to see how she survived the destruction of her village, how her family died and how she came to be enslaved with Annisa fighting for her life in the slave pits; while at the same time having a story with the completed article, the Red Sonja that we all know.For me the strongest and the weakest part of this book is its ending. Now I know that sentence is a complete contradiction, but allow me to explain. The book ties up everything and I mean absolutely any plot hook, any concept and any person who was seen in this book gets a resolution. This is wonderful in one way because what feels like backstory for the sake of giving us some context to the story is in fact vital for everything that happens. However it means that everything feels really contrived. Three or so bits of vital information that all come about at the same time on the same day in history all end up being combined and resolved all at the same time and it has left me in a difficult place to describe it.If this was a one shot book about a new character then it would work fine because you get that nice arc to the story, but for a character that is supposed to be part of an ongoing title it makes me question if every story is going to be the same; meet character, see the flashback to the last time they met, fight, resolution that ties everything up neatly. In fact, I have seen this done exactly in this way before and it was a TV series called Zena. You had 45 minutes to set up the plot, see where that came from in her chequered past and then watch it get resolved in the present. It works for a syndicated TV series where people have short attention spans and do not necessarily expect to catch the next episode, but in a title which is supposedly an ongoing series I am not convinced it works so well. I feel like I have read &#8216;Red Sonja;&#8217; I have seen her as a child, young woman and mature dealer of death, the story has come full circle and she walks off into the sunset; why do I want to pick up issue 7?Overall this is a good book and as a standalone trade then I could definitely recommend it to people who like the swords and (limited) sorcery. It is humorous in places, generally involving alcohol; it is plain ridiculous in places, check out the leeches the size of pythons; it is a complete story from beginning to end, but it feels like a terrible way to draw readers into a larger ongoing story.",3.0

8022,"Confusing, convoluted plot aside (because we expect that sort of thing now; let's be honest, we read these books for the characters) there was one aspect that forced me to take off a star: the story is told from Ty, Zane, AND Nick 's POV.A significant portion of  the book (besides that crazy plot!) was actually focused on Nick. Although I'm fond of Nick, and am interested in his take on things and his personal story, I really felt that it detracted from the Ty/Zane dynamic. I didn't get as much time with them as I'm used to and therefore wasn't able to go as deep with them. I kind of thought the sidewinder series was there to focus on Nick, while the cut & run was for our feisty pair.Don't misunderstand, there are still great Ty/Zane moments. I'm just used to it being all about them. I feel like I was spoiled with 7 books of pure Ty/Zane and now I have to share with Nick and don't wanna hahaBut whatever. I read these books to be entertained and I was entertained, so mission accomplished.So basically I liked it well enough.

8027,"After reading D. Nathan Hilliards&#8217; book Ghost, Monsters and Madmen I just had to read another anthology, as he seamlessly spawns them so naturally.Each tale was as mysteriously intriguing as the next with authentic characters and unnerving entities. Most of the endings left me pondering what if and wanting more.Even though each tale was incomparable with the next I found vengeance a common element threaded throughout the entities demeanours.Some tales described what outsiders to the events thought which sent chills down my spine and would make one think an occurrence of death whether classed as murder or natural maybe more than meets the eye.Exploring through the pages of horror I found scenes of every entity unforgettable and couldn&#8217;t help but fear them all. I thought the most feared to be Lamar Tarlington due to occult connections and sickening acts of his past. The scenes from Janies encounter in the &#8220;Legacy of Flies&#8221; as well as Russells&#8217; in &#8220;A Singularity of Purpose&#8221; provided an adrenaline rush.The book ended with a heart-warming tale, tears on my pillow and thoughts that made me reminisce about love ones that have passed.I highly recommend these tales of terror and my other favorite with even more tales and bite &#34;Ghost, Monsters and Madmen&#34;.",5.0

8035,"Early in his book, when describing the video game of Pong, the author of Steve Jobs's biography puts the following aside: ""If you're under thirty, ask your parents."" My son is only sixteen, and this is a book I would easily recommend to him or to people his age. They are at an age when they need to learn the power of dreams, the intricacies of life, the tragedy of sickness and death. They need role models they can look up to, while knowing at the same time that they will have to figure out by themselves what to do with their lives. I remember that my son was touched by Steve Jobs's death in more than a superficial way. So were all the young people who showed up at Apple stores worldwide to leave messages of bereavement and homage. Even with very little knowledge about his life, the CEO of Apple provided them with an alternate father figure. For them, he was this cool guy who spoke from a platform to disclose cool products, wearing his trademark black turtleneck and sporting a well-groomed beard.Steve Jobs actively contributed to his own legend. In countless interviews and magazine articles, he referred to his youth growing up in the counterculture of the seventies in California, where psychedelic drugs and progressive rock music merged with a DIY engineering culture. During lectures, he provoked university students with questions like: ""When did you lose your virginity"", or ""Did you try getting high on acid or LSD?"" More positively, he encouraged them to create their own business and to do things their own way. Creating one's startup in one's garage became a rite of passage for all aspiring entrepreneurs. After his return to the company that ousted him, Jobs became a symbol of reinvention and renaissance, an illustration of the saying that, in business as in life, it's not over until it's done.Perhaps more than stories about himself, which he couldn't always control, Jobs was careful to select self-portraits, and he refined his visual image with the same care he applied to the design of Apple's products. Job's first mentor had taught him how to ""impute"": to understand that people do judge a book by its cover, and therefore all the trappings and packaging of Apple signaled the value and importance of everything it was producing. Walter Isaacson's book cover is a fine example of minimalist style and attention for detail that characterized Steve Jobs's aesthetics. Its design was allegedly the only intervention that Jobs made in the book, leaving otherwise the biographer complete freedom to tell and interpret his story as he pleased. The book therefore gets the best of both worlds: it combines the widespread access to sources of an authorized biography and the independence of a well-researched journalistic account. Its publication two weeks after Jobs's disappearance couldn't have been more timely, and it met with enthusiastic critical applause.This book helped popularize the expression ""reality distortion field"" that many coworkers used to describe Jobs's ability to warp reality around his vision. The expression actually comes from Star Trek, like so many pop culture references of people belonging to the same generation. As expressed by this metaphor, some people have the power to bend space and time in their immediate vicinity. In their presence, reality is malleable, and the laws of gravity or attraction no longer apply. They can recreate their own world through sheer mental force, and impair upon people around them the vision that animates them. This spiritual power has become the staple of countless science-fiction movies, from The Matrix to Star Wars.Like the force in Star Wars, there was a dark side to the reality distortion field as well. ""To some people, calling it a reality distortion field was just a clever way to say that Jobs tended to lie,"" notes the biographer. This fits the portrait presented in the book: Jobs was often manipulative, and had a very particular relationship with the truth. The first person he tried to deceive was often himself. Like many self-absorbed persons, he selected within facts and figures the elements that fit his own plans, and discarded the other pieces of information as irrelevant. ""He can deceive himself,"" observed one of his close friends. ""It allows him to con people into believing his vision, because he has personally embraced and internalized it."" ""It was a self-fulfilling distortion,"" commented another. ""You did the impossible, because you didn't realize it was impossible.""At the root of reality distortion was Jobs's belief that the rules didn't apply to him. He was notorious for not putting a license plate on his car and parking it in the handicapped space, sometimes straddling two places. If he didn't want to deal with something--a legal annoyance, a business issue, his cancer diagnosis, a family tug--he could resolutely ignore it. ""Don't compromise"" was one of his favorite motto. He was alien to the idea of making trade-offs, and was intolerant of anyone who couldn't live up to his very exacting standards. He considered being rude to be part of his job description. ""If something sucks, I tell people in their face. It's my job to be honest,"" he told his biographer. As a collaborator remarked, ""we learned to interpret 'This is s***' to actually be a question that means, 'Tell me why this is the best way to do it'"". He often stated his goals in grandiose terms. ""Making a dent in the universe,"" and ""sending ripples to the galaxy,"" was how he described his purpose in life.A basic tenet of this book is that Jobs's personality was reflected in the products he created. Steve Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and his quest for perfection led him to control every aspect of a product's design, including its inner components and the paint color of the machines on which they were produced. One of his core principles was that hardware and software should be tightly integrated. ""Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana,"", he said, referring to Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak. His instinct for integrated systems and his drive for control put him squarely on one side of the most fundamental divide in the digital world: open versus closed. Very often, his insistence on producing close systems met with dire warnings. ""If Apple continues to rely on a proprietary architecture, the iPod will likely become a niche product,"" declared Harvard professor Clayton Christensen. ""Closed is the kiss of death,"" decreed another expert. But Apple was able to reinvent itself several times, betting the whole house at every juncture and revolutionizing whole industries in the process. Our world without Apple would have been a very different one.In the US context, this book would probably be rated 'R'. There are many instances of profanity and foul language, and the reader is spared no detail of Steve Jobs's wild years growing up in California. Apple's CEO remained true to his upbringing: he liked to state that ""taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things that he'd done in his life."" His advice to young people was: ""Stay hungry. Stay foolish."" He launched the advertising campaign ""Think different"" and ""Here is to the crazy ones"", which made for good marketing slogans but cannot be easily adopted as guidance for corporate strategy or parental education. But I am of the opinion that teenagers should be exposed early to the facts of life, and that they be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them. For these reasons, I am rating Steve Jobs's biography 'PG-13', and I am recommending it as birthday present to young people of the Internet generation.",5.0
8036,"I found this book hard to put down. I loved that each chapter started with a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt. Sometimes it took awhile to connect the quote to the content of the chapter it headed. This was written in the 'first person' but was not self-centered. Some of the content could have been censored some, since it was rather personal. This is the first time I've read this author, but I would search out more of her writings. I enjoyed the honesty shown as she experiences her personal growth in confronting her fears for a year. I appreciated that she did not dwell on every fear she conquered, but a brief rundown of some of the smaller ones would have been enlightening. We all have large fears that may paralyze us at times, but the daily fears may be the ones that drive us to eat the wrong thing or say something not so nice. It also piqued my interest to search out more books on the Roosevelt's and their life together, and how Eleanor managed to handle the life she had chosen to stay in.

The central character is Humanity itself.Personally, I would not only have welcomed many more accounts of this epic struggle, I would have enjoyed more elaboration of the existing stories.

I read because I want to see how she does it.

But you cannot live  outside the welter of colliding materials.&#34;She draws on quotations of deep thinkers of all philosophies, including Buddhist and Hebrew as well as Christian..She reminds us of our mortality, and how difficult it is for us to accept it, and in her usual curiosity, offers questions for everyone, for herself, for God.  &#34;We are only about three hundred generations from ten thousand years ago.&#34; she reminds us.Stories, quotations, experiences, ideas build until you get the connections, or at least keep thinking.Suzanne.,",4.0

If you have to mix a variety of ingredients in a bowl with a mixer and then &#34;dump&#34; them into a 9 x 13--not really a dump recipe unless one is using dump synonymously with pouring batter into a pan. The book is full of recipes like that. They may be great recipes, I don't know--but they are not all dump recipes by a long shot.2) The companion book for dump casseroles was really what I was interested in and it is a complete waste of paper.  It consists of about 30 pages, many printed on only one side.  The recipes are NOT dump recipes. They require browning and mixing and all manner of kitchen hubbub to get the casserole into the oven.

8052,"FM for Murder by Patricia Rockwell made me a fan. I had previously read Valentined, a book in another series that she has written. I loved this one even more. FM for Murder is the second in her acoustic mystery series.Patricia Barnes is a psychology professor who is enlisted for help with figuring out who murdered a disc jockey.  Her own daughter heard the murder happen on the radio. The disc jockey, AKA The Black Vulture, says a few words on the air before he is shot. Meanwhile we have flashbacks to a few days before with the story of Daniel Bridgewater. He is in charge of Bridgewater Carpets, a job that he does very well. His elderly father, the Charles, wants him to get married. But Daniel is determined to find his estranged brother. He is hoping that reconciliation can be achieved between the two before his father passes away.Patricia has the recording of the last minutes before the disc jockey was shot and listens it over and over again for clues about the voices on the tape.There are a lot of family secrets in story and information about acoustics in forensics. I really enjoyed learning about acoustics. Also there are false leads and big surprises. Towards the end, I kept saying &#8220;Oh!&#8221; out loud and my husband checked with me twice to see if was OK! It was that good.

This tale is so real that I can't help but want to prepare for the world's end (I have to be honest and say that I want to be the one with an abundance of Ravioli and Spagheti-Os) With that being said, this story got my adrenaline going.

8065,"Awesome story!I loved it all--from the emotions both characters brought about to the sweetness of the romance all the way through the funny moments and flirtatious banter.Lex Martin captured my attention instantly. She had me grinning from the moment Clementine and Gavin and anticipating when they would get together. Their connection was evident but developed slowly. Through some entertaining dialogue and funny moments, Lex Martin brought their connection to the surface and strengthened it the more time Gavin and Clementine spent together.I loved that their romance was not rushed. The pace worked well with the characters and the underlying conflict that was taking place. Their story felt believable and I could not put it down.It helped that the main characters were complex and intriguing. They had different personalities but complimented each other well by bringing the best out of the other. Gavin's flirtatious comments and laid back personality worked well with Clementine who had withdrawn into herself in the last years. Their interactions flowed easily through the page and only worked to deepened the connection that was already growing between them.Of course, Gavin and Clementine's chemistry worked well too. Although they each held back and started more as friends, their attraction was always under the surface of their interactions. I liked the fact that they had their doubts, but enjoyed it very much when they gave in to what the other was making them feel. I only wish I could have experienced some of the story through Gavin's eyes. He was a great character and I bet that his POV would have made this an even better story for me. However, the author did a great job of bringing forth his emotions and his character's personality to the page in a way that I felt that I could connect to him just as much as I did Clementine.The introduction of the secondary characters added to the story too. They each brought something different to the story whenever they interacted with either Gavin or Clementine. I'm especially curious about Clementine's brother Jax. He was so very different from his sister, but something tells me that he has more layers to him that what was let on in this story.With a bit of emotion, an abundance of chemistry and a great cast of characters, Dearest Clementine was a wonderful first book in a series.

I wanted to leave a comment on 2 very significant errors that I noticed right off the bat. The first is with the biscuit recipe on page 15. It calls for 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of heavy cream, and  cup of buttermilk. I make biscuits all the time, both with cream and buttermilk- I can say that the ratio of liquid to flour is incorrect. At the most you would use -1 cup of liquid for 2 cups of flour. This biscuit recipe is incorrect and will yield a liquid doughy mess. The second mistake I noticed was in the grits/egg casserole on page 23. They use 1 cup of quick grits, with 2 cups of water and 2 cups of milk. Again the liquids to grits ratio is inaccurate (4 &#62; 1). Those will be the soupiest grits ever. The recipes need some serious editing.

Kylie crushed on Trent for years, never to have her feelings returned except in the form of friendship. Then there&#8217;s Dray. Holy hottie on a stick! Kylie&#8217;s treated him like a brother and he&#8217;s been a total jerk to her most of that time.Then things change. And boy do they ever! What Kylie thought she knew about the men in her life is brought into question. There&#8217;s so much to consider and this is a heartfelt look at the turmoil that Kylie faces as what she thought she believed and felt turns on its head. My heart beat fast, I laughed, cried, and steamed up the place with the hotness factor. I truly appreciate that Nicole Reed pulled me through all of those emotions.Another factor that made this a win for me is Nicole Reed&#8217;s inclusion and treatment of Kylie&#8217;s relationships outside of Dray and Trent. Her best friend, Madison, her employees, and her mom and aunt. The depth of relationships, particularly with Madison and her aunt, Leigh, and the way Nicole adds humor and love and pain left me feeling as though I were also a part of their relationships.Overall, Nicole Reed delivered a don&#8217;t want to put it down read. There are a few twists that I didn&#8217;t expect and in the end, I felt it ended in the best way possible. I will definitely be reading other books by Nicole Reed as her dialogue, pacing, and story line captured me from the beginning and had me trying to find ways to read non-stop.",4.0

There is murder - hell, wherever Drusilla is, there always seems to be murder - but this time she's not to blame.Who am I kidding, you won't see it coming. Not even when it's coming right at you, you won't see it coming.Each book sharpens Ms. Patterson's skills and she should be encouraged to keep sharpening, keep sharpening and soon enough everyone will here Drusilla coming.",5.0

8093,"This book, An Astronaut's Guide To Life On Earth, by (who else) astronaut Chris Hadfield, is just a great read on a number of levels.  First, it is very well written and edited, so there is no wincing as he discusses his adventures, reminisces on his past, and gives advice to, well, practically anybody.  I grew up in an age where it literally was a kid's dream to become an astronaut, so I can understand his childhood fascination (obsession?) to get into space, even at a time when there were no Canadian astronauts.  He worked very, very hard to make it into these ranks, and the book focuses in large part on his suggestions for others who have dreams.  Work hard, study hard, don't be a braggart, practice, practice, practice...  Really, is there anything in life that wouldn't be improved with this focus... swimming, cello, chemistry, or parenting?But the focus really is an insiders guide to being in space as an astronaut.  Hadfield spent time on both the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station (ISS).  When does Joe and Jane Public get a chance to visualize life in space, real space, not the sci-fi variety?  For most of us, this is as close as we will get.  Take advantage of this, to slip the surly bonds of Earth...",5.0
8094,"Rich Greenlaw has just got laid off and is visiting his parents in Benton Harbor, Michigan.  He decides to take a tour of a newly refurbished historical mansion.  He recognizes a house in one of the pictures in the mansion and begins to wonder if it is the same place he used to fish with his grandfather.  He takes his mother with him the next weekend to see if she remembers anything; she does and the mystery begins.  While touring the mansion, his mother also finds out from the curator that they are in need of a part-time handyman.  Rich has plenty of time and experience, so he applies for and gets the job.Rich enjoys history and anything mechanical, so he soaks up the atmosphere in the mansion.  He also finds the curator, Patricia, very attractive.  Soon their relationship becomes more than employee and employer, but they are both afraid of making a commitment and voicing their growing feelings for one another.  Meanwhile, Rich is using his job to learn more about his grandfather, who is now deceased, and his alleged relationship some seventy years ago with the former owner of the mansion, the wealthy Rebecca Eastwick.The negatives to this story for me were the plot moved slowly in some parts and the unnecessary swearing.  Also, there were many typos in the book.  The positives were some great laugh out loud internal comments Rich made about himself or his mother.  I loved the relationship Rich had with his parents, the teasing between his parents and between himself and his parents.  The dialogue and fun relationship with Patricia was also really entertaining and absolutely hilarious to read at times.  I also thought it was very admirable how Rich handled his relationship with his kids by not bad mouthing his ex-wife in front of them or even when he was not in front of them.  He also treated her with much more respect than the nasty lady earned.  I would be interested in reading more books from this author.",4.0
8095,"Being a hard core vegetarian in my family for generations, the part about dairy shook me up. Otherwise this was nothing for me to challenge in this book. I am glad Dr. Campbell has laid this work much against his early thinking not to write a book. It is fascinating none of major publishers were willing to publish his book. I am sure the lobby is at its work.I am really glad plant based eating and veganism is coming to the forefront - having its benefits in ones health, environment, earth, animals. The cruelty shown to animals in this earth is unbelievable for selfish human gains. Colin Campbell's scientific rigor is awesome, in spite of this he is attacked!

8098,"It says right on the cover, &#34;It's like the X-files written by Tom Clancy.&#34;One of the things I struggled with in Clancy's writings-well to be clear, some of his books-is that he uses A LOT of acronyms and military jargon. Clancy wasn't always great at clearing up what he was referring to, but luckily for me author, Weston Ochse, is better in that respect.Yes, he uses a lot of military jargon, but he either explains it or it's easier to decipher while reading in context.From the title alone, one can deduce that something wonky is going on, and Seal Team 666 is gonna clean it up for us. Seal Cadet Jack Walker is plucked from training and pushed through to become a member of Seal Team 666. And from there the action is pretty much non stop! Chimera, little demons that like to kick and scratch and nastier things that go bump in the night are aplenty.At times it was hard to keep the team members straight, on the other hand...well, read it and you'll get my drift.Early on in the book the team raids what can only be described as the worst kind of sweat shop, from there Ochse takes a few leaps and bounds in regards to moving the story forward, but I'll forgive him as the action was fun and wild!I'm looking forward to checking out Book two.",4.0
8099,"I&#8217;m not one to read a lot of books about infidelity. While the topic is intriguing, I find myself to be too emotionally attached to the story, biting my nails as I read, feeling little sympathy for any of the characters and just wishing it was over.That is not what happened with The Other Half.Chloe, our mistress, is headstrong and smart, seeking to excel in her new career. Maggie, our wife, is talented conservative, trying hard to keep her marriage together and her husband interested.  That husband is James to his mistress, Jaime to his wife. That man is weak, confused and unable to make decisions.Rayner does a great job making both women relate-able. I don&#8217;t love Maggie though I felt bad for her being in this marriage she feels like she has to fix. She finds herself being the wife she never wanted to be, constantly compromising her feelings and needs for her husband and child. And nagging him about it.  I don&#8217;t love Chloe because even though she is a good person at heart, she knows sleeping with a married man is wrong. Yes, it&#8217;s his fault too, but Chloe knew what she was doing and didn&#8217;t stop herself. Even when she feels guilty through the book when Maggie is calling James on his cell phone. They&#8217;re both different, yet brilliant. They&#8217;re both trying to find their way, and their one biggest obstacle is James.Jaime is shown both through Maggie and Chloe&#8217;s eyes, allowing the reader to see this complete person who is trapped, charming and very very lost. He may not intend to hurt anyone, but no one comes out of this book unscathed. Of all the characters, I wanted to slap James the most. He&#8217;s mean, selfish and a liar.The story moves fast, reading more like chick lit. It was easy to sit down for hours and lose myself in their drama. Will they get caught? Do you want them to? Who am I rooting for?Overall, I enjoyed The Other Half way more than I thought I would. It moves quickly and I was glued to my seat, eager to find out how it ends.Rating 7 Would Recommend",4.0

At times it seemed a bit tedious with the main character in yet another desperate situation so similar to previous ones, but that may be due to my old age.

The trilogy isn't without it's flaws, and in a less engaging story I would have stopped reading in book one.  The writing is so sublime but then an awkward or incorrect (by this I mean inappropriate in the context of the scene) word choice will pull me out of the story...but since I'm eager to know what happens next I keep reading.  That is a testimony to how very talented this author is, that in spite of the little flaws (which could be fixed with a good editor) I couldn't stop reading.  I'm very glad that the author stopped telling us every time a character had to &#34;answer nature's call&#34; (In Book one of the trilogy the reader was kept aware of how often the characters had to pee! lol)Gorgeous descriptions, intriguing characters and a compelling plot made this trilogy the most enjoyable one I've read in years, and the first one I've been invested enough in to finish in quite some time.  Now I'm off to see what else this author has written!",4.0

8113,"[...]Book Review: Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat: A Romance Fiction About Adulthood and Second AdulthoodCrimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is a fiction novel in Romance genre. Claude was born in Brussels and had her upbringing in Europe, Africa and America. She graduated in Economics from Columbia University. She has been versatile enough to put her hands on various professions &#8211; banking, publishing, journalism, marketing, teaching in a college and gradually landed in the Food and Agriculture Organizations, the United Nations in Rome as a project inspector. During her tenure of 20 years of successful career here she reached to a position of Director &#8211; Regional Representative &#8211; for Europe and Central Asia before retiring in 2003. She has many award winning books to her credit. She is one of the masters in Boomer literature aiming at Baby Boomers.Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is a romantic story but with a different level of gravity where one gets to understand the intricacies of matured passion and defies that could happen in the life after retirement which is also referred to as the second adulthood. There are five main characters in the book around whom the whole story of Crimson Clouds revolves. Robert is a 60 years old man, tall and quite attractive broadminded Frenchman who has spent almost his whole career in the United Nations climbing the career ladder to gradually reach to one of the highest levels. Robert is a man of great values and strong beliefs and differentiates well with a precision between Contemporary Art that he hates and the good art that he admires.Robert&#8217;s mother is a short, old lady but quite agile at her old age spending a good amount of time on her passion of painting even during her 90s. Robert&#8217;s father was a Consul of France in New York and she had no problem in balancing her life of being wife of a highly positioned diplomat and as a passionate painter. Natasha is the third main character of this story who has been with Robert since their childhood and both have maintained a good friendship. She is a journalist and an art photographer and is younger to Robert by around 5 years. She is the child of a French mother and a Russian father. Lastly we have two more important characters &#8211; Kay, younger to Robert by almost 20 years and is his wife. She, unlike Robert, loves Contemporary Art and has no interest in the values and beliefs maintained by Robert.Finally we have Nour who is 27 and Natasha&#8217;s daughter. Nour is intensely attractive but internally disturbed because of the circumstances she had to face during her youth when she lost her Iranian father in Paris and Natasha took over the complete responsibility of bringing her up. Nour has a drifting personality that gradually makes her an aimless entity in life.Overall, Crimson Clouds by Claude Nougat is quite intense, attention grabbing romance novel that will keep you hooked to it throughout because of strong characterization, excellent story and well woven plot.",4.0

In the recent blizzard here it took me five hours to drive home in traffic, and I hardly noticed as the intriguing story unraveled. I do like how he puts the legal system in human perspective - it actually helped me in real life.He took a risk setting the story in the deep South - it wasn't his first, and one wondered about freshness, but the twists, turns, mini-mysteries, unlikely heroes, and life lessons made it a worthwhile listen.",5.0

8122,"The Judge has correctly identified the result; Constitutional Freedom has been destroyed.  Unfortunately, he has misidentified the cause, as have most conservative writers on the Constitution.  The destruction began not long after implementation, as congress twisted the language and intent to accommodate their rapacious natures.  Thomas Jefferson, the principle author of the Constitution, wrote with &#8220;deepest affliction&#8221; to a friend in 1825, of his concerns about the restrictions on the federal government he had penned 38 years before and the &#8220;&#8230;rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the States, and the consolidation in itself of all powers, foreign and domestic&#8230; by constructions&#8230;that leave no limit to their power.  Under the power to regulate commerce, they assume indefinitely that also over agriculture and manufactures, and call it regulation to take the earnings of one of these branches of industry, and put them into the pockets of the other.&#8221;These &#8220;constructions&#8221; were remedied in 1861 by a new constitution which included the clause &#8220;nor shall any duties or taxes on importations from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry&#8221;.  It is not possible to give an advantage to one entity without simultaneously disadvantaging another, in this case northern congressmen passing tariffs supporting manufacture in their states which greatly disadvantaged southern states, which seceded from the union and wrote their own constitution, a vast improvement on the original in many of the adjustments.  But 750,000 deaths later rapaciousness resumed and the Confederate Constitution was delegated to an historic curiosity when the south lost the war.  The stench from the growing Oligarchy and graft gave credibility to the changes Judge Napolitano chronicles in this book, Theodore and Woodrow, and FDR as well.  But they were arguably a response to the chaos resulting from congressional graft at the time, and not the cause of the destruction.  Now liberals and conservatives face off, blaming each other, while graft and destruction of Liberty continue unabated at the source.",3.0

8139,"Let me Start off by saying this is the first Christian Fiction Novel that I have read with that being said the content of this book was greatly developed the twist and turns in this story was unbelievable,and it was written so well that I felt like I was apart of the story as it was being told. It was not predictable by the least bit but yet it was informative, eye opening, jaw dropping and thought provoking. The Sunday Morning Wife speaks to the hearts of abuse woman everywhere as well as it speaks to the hearts of the christians that may have questioned God and turn their backs on him for one reason or another. Thru this story you can find your way back to God. Yolanda faith in this story displays that even when your world is in discord, and you have nothing left to hold onto or nowhere to turn fight the fight that a true christian can fight, and watch God win the battle for you as he did for Yolanda.Character development was excellent because the characters were totally developed from beginning to end. Each character made you emphasize with them about their past,present and future. The characters pulled you into their world of totally you felt their anger, rage, depression, and their pain they felt throughout the story. They made you realize why they were who they were, and why they did the things they did.In Conclusion, this story taught faith, repentance, and trust in the Lord in all that you do and lean not on your own understanding.Once again the Author did a great job grammatically as well as structurally.",5.0

Chsitian Gray is a fascinating character study of a traumatized man with difficulties allowing intimacy.  I  Ifound myself wondering what he was thinking so much of the time since we are seeing this from Anastasia's perspective.Anastasia's goddess was a bit preachy at times and sometimes the sex was a little too much, but I would enjoy reading this type of story without the sex.  I am definitely going to read the books again and now I understand what all the fuss about these books was all about.",5.0

8149,"Dieting has so many negative connotations to it. The author is a nutritionist who has broken down the steps that are normally taken to lose weight and dissected what makes them work or fail. A little planning can change your diet into a lifestyle that will help you lose weight without the ups and downs, disappointments, and confusion.There are several of her recommendations that won't work for me. Several of them (1 carb a day, eat lots of fish protein) are unrealistic for me and my lifestyle. But overall the book seems to be filled with practical advice. Most of the things mentioned were common sense thoughts that I'd already heard (high protein breakfast, no snacks after supper, exercising every week). But for someone just starting out on the diet path, this book will be a great little resource.I received this book free of charge from Goodreads in exchange for my honest review.",3.0

Bo begins by showing Megan the farm and horses. Megan is unsure where her inner peace comes from, it's either her friendship with Bo or the horses themselves. As they continue to spend time together things become more complicated than either imagine.This is a wonderfully written romance with a small amount of suspense interwoven. This is a clean, feel good romance. The plot flows and will draw the reader in. Both characters are very strong and lovable.",5.0

8162,"I agree it started slowly but when you're building a rather massive story idea, the foundation just has to take time. At first I was in 'ok, what happens to X?' mode and resented the detail. As I read more, I started forcing myself to relax and enjoy the detail. You realize each character is giving you a different perception of central idea. The author really wants you to get the feel of each situation. Characters are revealed like peeling an onion - you get deeper each time they reappear. The fundamental idea behind it? I don't buy it but hey, it's fiction - and he remains true to the 'world' he has created - the crucial thing. It kept me up too many nights.I've been reading Sci-Fi since the late 50's so Asimov, Heinlein, etc. Also newer by Stross (Accelerando the best) , Neil Stephenson (Cryptonomicon!

8166,"I am yet adjusting to reading books through my kindle reader. It has been a trying transition from hard copy to digital. But this book MUDDIED By Meg Mathisen managed to make me completely forget about my issues with ebooks!. The format was delicious in the way it moved back and forth between past and present. It allowed you to root for the main character Greta at all points in her life. I do not know if there is any real connection with the author and this story, but it reads like a personal experience which translates to a very real feel. The character is so tragic and yet heroic at times that you end up feeling compelled to just give her a hug and a warm place to be. The tragedy experienced by all the characters induces genuine feelings of rage, terror and pity. MUDDIED kept my attention with unexpected surprises and throat clenching revelations. The scary overtones manage to leave you concerned about the characters and what will eventually become of them. I can also relate to the main characters night terrors. It felt so real that I slept with the lights on last night when I finished the book!. I am sure that there are those who will be able to relate to the drunken binges as a way to escape the pain of bad memories and a hard life. Overall I really liked this book and I appreciated the genuine effort that went into the writing. I hope that Meg Mathisen decides to do a follow up story so that we can see what happens to these people. I will be thinking of Greta for a long time to come as she is the type of character that leaves you feeling some kind of way and encourages you to pay closer attention to the choices you make in your own life.

As mysteries, the books are lacking a bit, but as humor they are superb.  There are five recurring, on screen, characters and two who are present but never witnessed.  The other characters are, unfortunately, disposable.  We should be able to see some of them again.  I think that some thread of history, which would give at least the four main characters an ability to grow and change, would be welcome in the books.

I guess that was the author's plan all along.His description of the aftermath left me wondering if this nice guy would turn into a rotten character too. This is a perfect description of how any of us may react to real world violence, thus changing us forever.I loved the characters, but be aware I have experienced just such a small mid-western college town. To others they may seem dry and a bit too &#34;ivory-tower&#34;. I loved 'em.

8175,"Being a sucker for Mickey Haller (and any Michael Connelly book) I hate to say a bad word, but in Gods of Guilt I had trouble (a) keeping track of who the characters were and (b) caring about the case. Haller once knew and had feelings for the murdered prostitute ... but did I read about that in an earlier book? I don't remember, so hard to get emotionally involved. The guy he's defending, on trial for her murder, is a pimp and not a character you can like very much. The connections between the drug king in prison and the DEA agent and the investigator Lankford with a longtime dislike for Haller. Did I read about that in an earlier book? I don't remember so hard to recall why he dislikes Haller, hard to figure out (even by the ending) what Lankford had to do with the DEA guy, the drug king, and the prostitute ... Haller's personal life and sort-of estrangement from his young daughter isn't explored enough to get the reader emotionally involved -- once again, the whole story of his ex wives and his daughter played out in earlier books ... and while I DO remember all that, the personal story is not woven very deeply into this book. So once again, it's hard to get emotionally involved in the story -- let alone keep the characters and plot points straight. THE BRIGHT SPOT is that the last few chapters really come to life with edge-of-your-chair events unfolding during the (at last) trial of the pimp, with a rousing and satisfying ending (and possible reconciliation of Haller and his daughter ... which may play out in future books. Which I will certainly read. In spite of this one sagging in the middle, I'm hooked on Mickey Haller and all Connelly books.)",3.0

8187,"There are a lot of erotica fans out there, and each one has different taste when it comes to titillating tales.  Some prefer a good plotline mixed in with their smut, while others take a more &#8220;get to the nitty gritty&#8221; approach.  They want their erotica hot, fast, and satisfying.  Mya Fanci delivers the latter packaged in a nice assortment of erotic tales in the short story series Spicy Collection Volume I.  The book includes:The Best Friend's BoyBench PressRanch HelpTexas TakeoffThe Roommate's CallTruth Be ToldNurse CareRoslyn ManorThe Slow ThawRoyal RendezvousThe stories are what one might consider as erotica for women.  Each tale is a fantasy come true for many readers out there, and the author sets the tone appropriately with the first story, My Best Friend&#8217;s Boy.  In it, a MILF named Stacey is surprised when her best friend&#8217;s son returns home on holiday from college looking like a completely different person.  He&#8217;s blossomed into a handsome young man who isn&#8217;t afraid to go after what he wants.  She soon discovers that the erotica she enjoys reading isn&#8217;t the only place where lovers make each other&#8217;s dreams come true.  Each subsequent addition is similarly written with a little something something for everyone.  Admittedly, my favorite is Truth Be Told, where patient and doctor confidentiality is of the utmost importance with two attractive neighbors.Spicy Collection I is tastefully done with sexy scenes that get straight to the point.  With 10 stories back to back, you&#8217;ll find yourself excited, maybe too excited, to finish.  This would be very awesome for couples who want to spice up their lovemaking, or a confident woman getting in the mood alone.

Since Iran is a place where most Americans hear of only horror stories, it was touching to read about the kindnesses. As she journeyed across Iran, I learned much about the different cities throughout the country as well as the culture of each. I'm heartened to hear that her research has encouraged her to pursue changes in the American system to make the possibility of kidney selling available.

8209,"Ar first I thought this book was mainly aimed at novice lockpickers. The author made some recommendations that seemed like they were aimed at helping the user spend money wisely. Then came the section on tubular lock picking and it went off the rails. The first style of lockpicks were very basic and quite affordable as well as being effective. Then the author went on to endorse a lock-picking tool that cost well over $400 and that required different ""tips"" at $50 each. This tool was HUGE and awkward to use unless you were in a lock shop or at home on a workbench. Totally impractical for field use. The name of the tool is the ""Peterson Pro-1 Tubular Lockpick"" by Peterson Manufacturing. They have a website and you can view the lockpick and it's accessories there.What the author totally ignored was the Deluxe ACE Tubular Lockpick. This item is sold in many stores and you can see it being used in the excellent video ""Lock Picking for the New Millenium"". It cost much less at around $270 and no additional parts are necessary. It's easier to use and is much more compact. Perfect for both the novice and the pro.There were other recommendations that I have found to be not that good, especially when it came to individual picks. The book is easy enough to read, but I would be careful about taking it's recommendations. Makes me wonder if the author is getting some kind of kickback from certain lockpick tool makers.",3.0

8211,"This book is book 2 in a series, which I realized when I bought it, and you don&#8217;t need to read the first book to understand what&#8217;s going on in this book, they give enough background on the main characters. It works as a standalone.The writing level is decent, about a 3/4 out of 5 stars for writing. The author probably won&#8217;t be winning any awards, but at least it didn&#8217;t annoy me and was well edited. The storyline is a 3 out of 5, it was really slow in the beginning. And just to point out, the title is &#8216;Never Courted, Suddenly Wed&#8217;, but the heroine, Sophie, is courted, by 2 men, for most the book, which in the storyline is approx 2 weeks. Than the Hero, Christopher, compromises her, and another week later they are wed. When they finally do wed it&#8217;s at 70% through the book. So I wouldn&#8217;t say she was never courted, and quite the opposite of &#8220;suddenly&#8221; wed!The first 70% of the book drags on, there are some funny scenes, and I did laugh, but it got a little tedious. You really learn a lot of their past as childhood nemesis&#8217;s and ALL the stuff they did to each other. Though Christopher was 14 and Sophie was 7, why would he have cared back then? Anyway, once they are wed everything seems lovely, everyone is happy, they are in the country enjoying their wedding trip, than Christopher&#8217;s dad arrives, he stirs up some trouble and Sophie runs away. This is at just over 82% through the book. Christopher follows her and they make up very quickly because the book than ends.Christopher turns out to be dyslexic and it would have been nice to spend some time on how Sophie would help him deal with it, it could have been a great bridge for them to cross together. Also it was once mentioned that while he couldn&#8217;t read because the words didn&#8217;t always make sense (dyslexia), it says he&#8217;s always been great with numbers, his dad being in debt, it would have been great if we could have seen how brilliant he really was when it came to accounting, instead of being told in one short blob in the book. Also throughout the whole book Sophie&#8217;s brother is made to look like, and they even refer to him, as a &#8220;pompous ass&#8221;, than at the very end he says how he cares for her, and how he even rejected several marriage offers because he wanted her to be happy in marriage, what!?! So out of character for him!!! And Sophie&#8217;s mother was no better, she was always pushing her needs above her daughters than when Sophie gets married she acts so uncharacteristically, I wasn&#8217;t buying it on either accounts.Overall a decent read. Not the best, not the worst I&#8217;ve read, falls right into the mediocre level, hence 3 stars. I&#8217;d only recommend if it&#8217;s on sale and you want a light, easy read, it does offer some humorous scenes in the beginning but brace yourself for a quick wrap up as the ending.",3.0
8212,"Christmas in Apple Ridge by Cindy Woodsmall, is a three story contemporary compilation centering around a small town in Pennsylvania. These are full books compiled here, not novellas, so you get a lot of reading for your money with this volume, it's a good bargain.The first installment is The Sound of Sleigh Bells, and although very solidly written it is my least favorite of the three. In this story we meet Beth Hertzler, co-owner of the local dry goods store, and Jonah, a wood carver from Ohio who is suffering the physical effects of a sleighing accident. Beth has been mourning the death of her fiance for what her aunt, Lizzy, believes is an unhealthy amount of time. When Beth meets Jonah during a business trip and is drawn to his talent and soft spoken manner, Lizzie conspires to bring the two very reserved and wounded souls together in friendship via letter writing. The complication is that both Beth and Jonah are under some misunderstanding about who they are actually writing to. Will Lizzy's plan backfire or finally bring love to two people who had given up on marriage? This story dragged a bit in the middle, but the reveal toward the end of Beth's back story was quite unexpected and interesting. It is well worth reading, and these two characters appear again in both of the next two stories in the most charming of ways.  The Christmas Singing features Mattie and Gideon. Mattie was heartbroken when Gideon broke up with her on Christmas Eve and has worked hard to hide her heart from anyone who tries to take it. Gideon has lived with a secret illness and brokenness since his break-up with Mattie. Can they get along enough to figure out they still love each other? The message in this book was to trust God with everything. You can't protect everyone, only God can do that. The Dawn of ChristmasThis is the story of Levi and Sadie. Sadie was engaged once and found that she could not trust her fiance after finding him with her cousin. She left and went on a three year mission trip to Peru. When she returns home, she is determined to remain single.She is literally thrown together Levi and when Sadie saves him after an accident. Levi is also determined to stay single after friends of his have gone have experienced heartache. One of those friends is the old fiance of Sadie. The two join forced to stay singe and soon find out that they may have found what they weren't looking for.Over all - they were all wonderful Christmas stories. I really love to read novellas since they are fast and easy reads. I would recommend them to anyone looking for inspiring holiday stories.  NOTE : I received a copy of Christmas in Apple Ridge at no cost, in exchange for an honest review, by Waterbrook Press.",5.0

I work at a library, and I would totally recommend this to any reluctant reader. The illustrations are pretty consistent and the storyline was solid.

8232,"REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT DEAR AUTHOR WHERE I RECEIVED THE BOOK AS FREE REVIEWING COPYDear KJ Charles,I reviewed the first book in this series here. Now that some time has passed I can say that it was probably my favorite m/m book last year. I am usually wary of reading the sequel to a beloved book, because I worry whether the sequel will live up to the high bar that the first book raised. I am glad that for me this sequel definitely did. Now I can worry about the third book.This book should not be read as a stand &#8211; alone. If you do read this first, I do not think you will be terribly confused, because the adventure/mystery plot is a new one, but the book continues to build up the relationship between the main characters, Lucien Crane and Stephen Day, and most importantly it once again develops their characters in the midst of all that danger, magic and mayhem.One of the main reasons why I often scoff at the possibility of a sequel (or series developed) to a book I loved is because so many authors seem to be so very fond of creating artificial conflicts between the couple, just to break them up for the sake of another book and then putting them back together at the end. But there is absolutely nothing artificial in the tension between Stephen and Lucien in this book, because it arises out of who they are, and the unresolved issues in their relationship are believable because their relationship is only several months old. And of course there is a nice external danger to both of them, which made perfect sense in the context of the mystery/adventure plot.More importantly, the unresolved issues between the men do not make them act like idiots. For example, in the very beginning of the book somebody has decided to blackmail Lucien over his relationship with Stephen and made his demands known to Lucien. It is part of Lucien&#8217;s nature to try and protect Stephen (even though he is aware of Stephen&#8217;s abilities to protect himself). I was very pleased to see that it did not occur to Lucien to hide the blackmailer&#8217;s visit from Stephen, and he let his lover know as soon as possible about the blackmail attempt. I do not know why I was even worried for a second that this would be the source of a quarrel between the guys and a reason for manufactured conflict/breakup/angst (take your pick). I really must start trusting this writer not to lead me towards silly plot turns.I was also pleased to see both men becoming more and more aware of each other flaws, but still loving each other more, not less. It was refreshing to see Lucien realize (with a little push from Merrick) how much Stephen&#8217;s pride means to him and try to curb his own &#8220;wanting to rescue&#8221; tendencies. At the same time Stephen would at least attempt to ask for help, hopefully because he understood that asking for help sometimes did not make him weak. And their declaration of love was so appropriate and so suited to both of them. When we see Stephen&#8217;s desire to protect Lucien at all costs despite what it seemed to have cost him in terms of his cherished job, it made me wonder whether these men are really that different inside. I decided not.I must praise the adventure/mystery/magic storyline &#8211; I loved it just as much as I loved it in the first book. It made the characters shine, but more importantly it made me hold my breath wondering what would happen next and I read without hesitation the creepiness that I am usually more likely to pass in many other books. I did not want to miss a word; I had to know what was going on. I was also pleased to become more acquainted with Stephen&#8217;s partner Esther and other practitioners from his team. I am really hoping that I will see more of them in the next book of these series. I liked Esther a lot, but I think she could have used more fleshing out. Merrick, Crane&#8217;s manservant and friend was just as awesome in this book, and I while I was a bit scared to see the extent of his ruthlessness, I am glad the writer did not shy away from it. I liked that we learned more about what Merrick and Crane did in China as well.The writing was just as wonderful as in the first book. Here is an example to give you a taste, so that you can decide whether it works for you. Lucien was asked to do a little translating work for Stephen and his team ;).&#8220;Crane knew from Stephen that Mrs. Gold was the senior member of the team, and that she resented the common assumption that she was subordinate to the men. He addressed his next words to her. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t think this is a vulgar curiosity, but if you want me to translate when someone arrives, it would help to know what I need to discuss. What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;The practitioners glanced at each other, quick fleeting looks. Esther Gold said,&#8220;Rats.&#8221;&#8220;Rats?&#8221;&#8220;Rats.&#8221;&#8220;We got a rat problem.&#8221; Saint wore a malicious grin.&#8220;I suppose you know you can hire a man and a dog in any pub in this city,&#8221; Crane offered blandly.&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t help,&#8221; Stephen said. &#8220;Joss, show him.&#8221;Janossi put a toe under a fold of the sackcloth bundle and flipped it over. Crane walked over and looked at what lay within.It was undeniably a rat. It long yellow teeth were bared in death. Its eyes were blood-filled and bulging, which Crane attributed to Stephen, since he had seen a man dead that way at his hands. Its matted, dirty brown pelt was stiff with filth and dust, its claws were grey and scaly, its naked tail pinkish. It was a rat like any other, except in one respect.It was about four feet long, not counting the tail, and would have stood perhaps a foot high at the shoulder.&#8221;I cannot wait for the next installment in this series. Oh and what a refreshing idea it is, to choose not to end every book in the series with the cliffhanger.Recommended.Grade A-",5.0

8235,"No doubt Kresley Cole knows how to write a hot story. In The Warlord Wants Forever, she does it again. The story of Nicolai Wroth and Myst the Coveted is as spicy and entertaining as you can expect. But there is something missing in this book. I really liked it&#8230; but not as much as the ones I read before.Nicolai falls for Myst after meeting her in a dungeon in a castle belonging to the Horde he has just captured. Myst feels immediately attracted by the austere warrior, but after blooding him she abandons him to suffer for five years the anguish of wanting release and being unable to get it. When Nicolai finally finds her in New Orleans, he unexpectedly encounters the means to make her suffer the same way she did to him, but he decides to use his new weapon to make her fall in love with him.Well, maybe I am a bit rancorous, but I just don&#8217;t get that the revenge you have been demanding for five years can be so easily forgotten. I mean, Nicolai is a bit softie when it comes to his Bride. As for Myst&#8230; She behaved like a real bitch and then she also forgets easily&#8230; I like the book, but I think there should be more tension, more working in the relationship between these two. I had the impression that they both changed their minds way too fast. Maybe it is because it is the first book of the saga and she doesn&#8217;t elaborate as much as the following ones. No doubt I should have read it first, but as always I started the series with the second (the one I had at hand) and got engrossed in the books and forgot there was a previous one. Anyway, the book is great, and I really enjoyed discovering the story of the eldest of the really juicy Wroth brothers.",4.0

8239,"As CEO of the world's most successful energy company, Lowell Bracken is at the top of his game and beginning to plan for his children to succeed him. But when a small upstart solar power company enters the scene, it triggers a series of political dominoes that will completely destabilize the power structures of the entire planet, and Lowell will be lucky to escape with his children - and his skin - intact.This one is hard to pigeon hole. Part eco-drama. Part fantasy. Part political thriller. It's set on an alien planet, but with a tech level similar to our own. There is some kind of pseudo-magic, and dragons, but both are kept fairly low key in this first installment.Despite these promising elements, this one didn't quite grab me. Lowell in particular seemed rather inconsistent. He's touted as a ruthless and ultra-savvy CEO who built his company up from ashes, against heroic obstacles. But when the chips were down, I never saw any of that heroic ferocity and competence in evidence. If anything, he comes across as a has-been who is now easily duped and slightly bewildered. It's one of those cases where the author describes the kind of character we all love to admire, but doesn't actually write him in a way that's consistent with the hype. And while some of the other characters do live up to their billing, they are so uni-dimensional that I wasn't able to bond emotionally with any of them.Overall, I felt like this book took me to the brink of a really enjoyable ride, but left me standing there. It didn't quite have the horsepower to tip me over the edge and deliver.",3.0

8243,"Fantastic, simply fantastic!!  In previous books of the Blood Curse series, we have read of how the Jaegar vampires (Dark) treated innocents and even their own people, it is beyond cruel, horrendous, or atrocious, but this is how Saber was raised and has lived for 800 years; now he has been told he was stolen and raised in the wrong house, that he is really a Jadon vampire (Light), how can he just change overnight to become someone else and Vanya (the destiny of Saber and our heroine) what she had been through, how she had been coping with becoming the person she thought she should be for herself and her people, but inside her heart wishing she could become the person she wanted to be.  The continual angst that Saber mind was always going through was a deep-down heartfelt thing to read along with the continual battle of Vanya struggling with who she wanted to become.  Ms Dawn wrote Saber's character and story so you can actually feel his torment and anger coming off the pages and could see the slow change taking place in Vanya; it is one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  My recommendation, read the previous books in this series, become familiar with the two different vampire factions, you will become totally engrossed with Ms Dawn's unique take on vampires that make up the storyline, and the Blood Curse series will become one of your favorites.",5.0
8244,"This book has a lot of promise to it.  It features a smart-ass white knight who fights to help those around him, even if they don't necessarily deserve - I kept thinking back to early Harry Dresden while reading this.Jesse was a young punk who turned his life around when he got involved in martial arts.  Now he tries to follow the way of the Samurai and fights to help people break contracts they've made with demons.I really wanted to like this story, but despite the good protagonist and interesting world, I just couldn't stay involved with the book.  About halfway through it started taking longer and longer for me to pick the book up again.  I eventually skimmed the rest of the book and put it down.I saw another review talk about how there's too much domesticity in this book, and I think that was part of the problem.  It's always nice to have the hero's every day life make an appearance in a book, but in this book there was too much family life, day job and visiting with friends. It slowed the pace down to a crawl and got a bit boring.Despite having trouble being hooked by this book, there was enough promise that I'll give book two a shot.",3.0

8261,"I liked this a lot. It's a slow burner. It not so much bursts from the traps as it does strides confidently from them, looks around, does things in its own time, and then when you're comfortable, it goes for the jugular.It's the tale of an unnamed narrator. He's a university professor, uprooted from an unfulfilling life in England with a wife he doesn't love, and planted back into the soil in Korea, or Seoul to be more specific (Seoul soil?), where he finds himself living an unfulfilling life with a wife he doesn't love, and a 'best friend' he barely knows. He teaches English Literature in a university where a falsified pass rate is infinitely more important than the education of Korea's young.Enter Hana Kim, an 18 year old student with both beauty and intelligence on her side. She approaches our narrator to discuss works of literature, and the pair begin regular meetings to discuss books, and life in general. From here on in he becomes besotted by the girl, initially by what she represents, which is a release from the mundanity of his existence. The longer the book goes on, the more unhinged and dangerous his obsession becomes.So yeah. It's a slow burner, but it's compulsive reading from the off. I had the narrator pegged as a selfish and blinkered fool early on, the way he constantly refers to his Mrs as 'The wife' with a disdain best reserved for enemies, the descriptions of his childhood spattered with venom whenever his over bearing mother is mentioned. He screams out to be shaken, and told to grow up, but I don't think he'd listen. Steve Justice has created a superb character in his narrator, and he fleshes the man out in such an expert manner that it's hard to believe that this is a debut.The bizarre mental justifications for his equally bizarre actions have you clenching your teeth in annoyance, wishing you could 'have a word' with him, to try to shake some sense into his stupid head. Seriously, it's getting me mad just thinking about it. And that, my friends, is one of the many strengths to Steve Justice's writing, he draws a reaction from you. He doesn't just tell you a story, he pulls you in to watch from close up, but without the luxury of being able to do anything about it.So I'd recommend this book any day of the week.

Truly, if this is how strong Steve Justice's debut novel is, I'm almost scared of what it will look like when he takes it to the next level. Powerful stuff.",5.0
8262,"I generally don't take the time to review books, especially ones that I do not finish but in this case I feel I have to.The premise of this book seemed interesting so I decided to give it a go but 20% in, I gave up. This book is riddled with grammatical and syntax errors. The writing is sophomoric at best. I felt like the story had potential but the writer really missed the mark on this one. Scenes jumped so quickly I had to keep looking back to see if I missed something. Descriptions of anything going on in the scene were pretty much nil.I apologize for the bluntness but, this book is a train wreck. It's not even one of those so bad it's funny books.

8264,"I recently wrote a critical review of Cris Putnam's new book, and it appears his drones did not like what I had to say.But, I did appreciate his contribution to this book.At the very least it is very informative of what the Catholic Church is doing and for that alone, it is worth buying.I am skeptical about the alien deception theory that they support or at least imply, and it is one of the bigger theories out there. I do not discount that something is going on, I know something is going on and it is not going away. That much I agree with. I do not believe we will see an alien spaceship land on the White House lawn and they will proclaim themselves our creators. Though, the theology and mystery behind these tales is interesting just by itself.The mere fact the Catholic Church is involved in this speaks volume of the issue. So, thus, it must be taken seriously, even if one does not agree or believe in it, it still must be taken seriously and everyone who has an interest in this issue, whether remotely or jump in the middle of it, must take this book into account.I do recommend this book, and Tom Horn and Cris Putnam offers an interesting take on a unique subject.",4.0

I have learned (through sometimes painful experience) not to expect too much from free books by authors I've never heard of, but this is special, special stuff! I don't know whether to describe it as a book of essays/short stories or a short book in the epistolary style, but however you describe it, the narrators and their stories get under your skin.

8272,"Title: For Such a TimeAuthor: Kate BreslinPublisher: Bethany HouseISBN: 978-0-7642-1160-7""Stella stared at the man beside her, this Jew Killer who had taken possession of her. With or without false papers, her life might only stretch as far as the next hour. What did he really want with her?"" Kate Breslin writes in her debut novel, ""For Such A Time.""At four hundred and thirty-two pages, this paperback targets those interested in historical fiction and romance, especially during World War Two when millions of Jews were sent to prison camps. With no profanity, the topic of war, abuse, and death would make the story not appropriate for nave readers. The ending includes the author's notes, a glossary of German and Jewish terms, eleven discussion questions, and acknowledgements.In this page-turner, twenty-three year old Hadassah Benjamin finds herself in front of a firing squad while she has been imprisoned at Dachau, Germany. After one shot is fired, she is saved by SS Kommadant Colonel Aric von Schmidt, who takes her to the transit camp in Czechoslovakia.Unable to comprehend fully why she has been brought into his private residence at the camp, her name is changed to Stella Muller and she becomes his secretary.  Her beautiful but beaten body takes time to heal as she prays God would convey His message to her.Befriending several other Jews within the ghetto, the Mischling does not want to be one of the German zoinehs the SS officers think she is. Forced to type up lists of adults and children to be sent on trains to Auschwitz, she struggles to keep her identity secret.As the Colonel commands the camp with its ruthless soldiers, he finds Stella to be unwavering, determined, and selfless when it comes to protecting those of the Jewish race. More than once, both must reign in their desires as they stay patriotic and loyal to their countries.With each chapter in sync with the Biblical story of Esther, Breslin saturates the tale with the need to call on God for guidance, knowing He is in control of all things. Her detailed, compassionate words give readers hope that overcomes the heartbreak during such a tumultuous time.Focusing on finding freedom both physically and spiritually, this book leaves readers remembering the horrific tragedy that happened so long ago and how man can learn from mistakes and find salvation.Thanks to Bethany House for furnishing this book in exchange for a review based on the reader's honest opinion.",5.0
8273,"This book really surprised me in so many ways. I expected just a &#8220;typical&#8221; romance book, but what I got was amazingly so much more! Romance and action go hand and hand with this novel. It will suck you in as you go places with Kathryn into her past that is filled with a lot of intense moments. There are tons and tons of supernatural occurrences which really added to this story, leaving you feeling breathless at moments. There are some steamy parts with Kathryn and Jared that will make your jaw drop just a bit. I kept saying to my sister, &#8220;Wow risky!&#8221; But it is still a clean romance, which I&#8217;m thankful about! If you want a unique romance this is it! The dialogue in this book is really, really amazing. Some flat out hilarious parts that actually made me laugh right out loud. I love the banter between the two main characters.

8275,"Three letters sum up my reaction to the book Younger Next Year: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy - Until You're 80 and Beyond by Chris Crowley and Henry Lodge. You can choose either WOW or OMG. For me, this is a life-changer. (At least I hope it is.) In reality, a lot of the information, the what, was not new to me. What was new was the why. And in this book, the why is pretty compelling. I found myself actually wanting to get to the gym more. That is pretty amazing. My diet is already pretty good, but I found myself wanting to make it better. The comparison between aging and decay rattled around in my head almost constantly. I was convinced pretty early in the book that decay is a very bad thing and generally is preventable.Younger Next Year is a book by men about men. That was not a turn off to me but it might be for some women. I was able to readily see that the science is the same, no matter the gender. Don't despair though, there is a version written specifically for women and I browsed it too. No matter which one you choose, the important thing is to read the book and follow Harry's Rules.

8287,"Reviewed by Angie Just Read...for TheRomanceReviews.comShe has a rule against dating neighbors, but the man next door would really like to get to know her.Hotel restaurant manager Nia Chambers got a peep show every time her next door neighbor took a shower, but she'd made a rule to never date a neighbor after her last relationship had soured and she'd had to move. So, Conn Lawler could flirt all he wanted to, but the steady stream of women to his door and Nia's ban on dating a neighbor put him squarely on her peep but don't touch list, that was until Nia's car wouldn't start.Carpenter Conn Lawler had been trying to get to know Nia Chambers for eight months. He found everything about her appealing, but Nia had ignored every neighborly overture he'd made towards her. Offering her a ride when her car wouldn't start was pretty much a dare for her to interact with him. He never expected a routine six-hour road trip in the snow would lead to overnighting with Nia in a motel and one of the hottest nights of his life. But Nia's clear that their night of passion won't lead to anything more; things will go back to the way they were when they return to their respective homes because Nia refuses to date a neighbor.But it's hard not to break the rules when the neighborly man next door is sweet, thoughtful, and nothing like the impression she'd formed of him. But Nia's looking for a man to marry and settle down with and Conn's not sold on happy ever after, even if his head and heart tell him the woman who refuses to date him is worth the fall.With the push and pull of attraction and the theme of commitment setting the tone, author Kara Doyle has penned a pleasing romance about two neighbors who have very different reasons for being gun shy with regards to the subject of love. Conn and Nia make a well-crafted and likable couple and are joined by a cast of equally likable secondary characters that bring added depth and insight to the evolving relationship dilemma. While readers can easily predict Conn and Nia will find their happily ever after, the getting there is the best part.",4.0

But turning sixteen isn't what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying to college, Nick is neck-deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person he's been told will ultimately kill him. But life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes it's the one that leaves your enemies confused. And sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you? What I dislike about the book is that it had a lot of pages to read. I would recommend this book to other people.",5.0

This is how this book is disturbing. Much like comedy that makes you laugh because if you don't laugh you would have to really confront an issue, this book is disturbing because it puts you in a situation that as much as i don't want to believe happens, I know deep down that not only can it, but it does.I know I am a bit vague here, it is a short story and i don't want to ruin it for anyone, but it is written so well I found myself wanting to yell at the book as if I were watching a horror movie.The horror of this book is it is too easy to imagine the events actually happening. Somehow in very few pages the main character comes to vibrant life and even though you can predict that something bad will happen, you hope against hope that you are wrong and that a &#34;fairy tale&#34; ending will swoop in at the last moment and make this a happy story!Bravo, to the author.

This shell explodes at a pre setting and out goes 22 pounds of steel fragments. This B-17 named &#34;RED LIGHT LADY&#34; had the misfortune of having a German 88mmm shell explode under the right wing. The explosion blew the number 4 engine right off the plane and flipped the plane up on its side and loosing altitude. The number 3 engine started acting up because it was not getting oil.As a result of damage caused the crew had to Bail out before the plane got out of control. The crew jumped out and all landed safely. The next problem was to find out where they were, Germany or France and try to get home. The crew was scattered too far at the time so they struck on their trip home in numbers of two and three. The escape was a very interesting and covered a lot of adventure. The book is well written and takes the reader through a lot of excitement.

I&#8217;m not talking to you. Does it look like I&#8217;m talking to you? I&#8217;m talking about you.  That&#8217;s not the same as talking to you.Invisible is a gripping thriller frothing with suspense:  this intense and sharp page-turner from co-authors, James Patterson and David Ellis delves into the dark truths surrounding Graham&#8212; a twisted  sarcastic murderer, that turns out be more complex and calculating than any of the collective law enforcement agencies can image.  Graham cleverly uses a recording device which resembles a cell phone to record the initial meeting with the pry of the moment while walking through a crowded establishment &#8211; such as a bar &#8211; and also uses it to record the sick torturous acts of pain precisely inflicted on the chosen victims; each murder&#8217;s finale is shrewdly disguised as an undetectable arson.  As the killer continues to claim victims, FBI researcher Emmy Dockery unearths baffling clues in her search for connections among the murders . . . and while she draws closer to finding the culprit, the culprit is watching and waiting to punish her.The final chapters of the climaxed conclusion will have readers stunned and satisfied.",4.0

8332,"I enjoyed this short story book so much that I read it in one sitting. The tales here are unique and original, each with a surprise ending that you don't expect to go the way it does.One of the things that I really liked about this compilation of stories, is that even thought they are short, the author managed to give the reader a sense of surrounding and who her characters are. I found it was easy to care about them, even in a shorter space of time than one finds in a full length book.The creativity with which these stories were written is a testament to the vibrant imagination of the author. This book takes the childhood fears as well as the more adult fears we all have at one time in our life or another and explores them in new ways.Another reason this book impressed me was that rather than just going for the fright factor, the author included other types of chills. Characters in very emotional situations gave weight to this collection that it would not have had otherwise. Fear, Sorrow,regret,sadness all work together to make this a complete book of Psychological and emotional chills.I did read this book whilst alone in the dark, and for a book entitled &#34;Chills,&#34; it certainly had the desired effect. I look forward to reading more work from this author.This review is based on a digital copy provided by the author for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own.",4.0

For years I never bothered to write a review but a recent request for a review (Good product Seagate Free Agent; used by a collector of OTR who I admired) prompted a spurt of reviewing.This gush, right now, is the latest review.Now, I have also read Blank Slate but writing about it from the state of no book at hand kind of suggests unintended absurdity or worse intended absurdity.What I do remember and praise is therefore general.Pinkers' observations are fresh, original, and engaging.He hammers a stake into quite a few false arguments, stale stereotypes, and ideas the likes of which you hear from O'Reilly in the excerpts played on the Daily show.He sheds, for me, light on a number of new ideas.  (I could say the same of Jared Diamond's Guns but it too went off to the great library book sale in the sky).And Pinker does this in a style that is clear, concise, fresh.

I figured I'd read a couple of paragraphs and if it didn't grab me I'd jump to the next story. There was no jumping and I had great difficulty putting it down and only did so for sleep. It was a light, happy, incredibly romantic story. I'm thrilled it was in the Romance Through the Ages anthology. I have since gone back and bought some of Ms. Darcy's other books. I wish I could articulate exactly why I was so engaged to help people make informed purchasing choices. It was a happy feel good read. I enjoyed the characters. The story may have been predictable to some - personally I don't consider that a criticism in a romance book as long as I enjoy the ride - but I didn't notice because I so enjoyed the ride and wanted to see how it all played out. Oh, there was plenty of tingles, spreading heat and passionate kisses without graphic sex so that alone won my lifelong loyalty as a reader.

Furthermore, Marion Dunraven, the only sane one of the bunch and the one Olivia is inexplicable drawn to, seems captive to everyone in the dusty old house.

He focused on the dark world of human trafficking, but he never gets preachy or political, nor does he exploit the topic gratuitously.  In PRIMAL fashion, it is what it is, and he deals with it executing a gripping story and dangerous mission around it.The recurring characters are each unique with well-developed flare.  It's like old home week reading the series and expecting that the personalities will make another appearance, which Jack routinely delivers.  Here he increases their depth, yet again.Military tactic and hardware enthusiasts have also come to expect the arsenal of toys that enable the PRIMAL team to dole out violent action justice against dregs of  humanity.

8376,"This book was just...wow. Like so many others I came to this book after Ender's Game (which I found to be a true masterpiece) and was so let down by what I found. I read the whole book hoping for it to get better, for some of the genius in Ender's Game to come through, but the story never did.First of all, this book isn't a sermon about Catholicism, it actually bashes it. A lot of it seemed to me like the author was thumbing his nose at Catholic beliefs and trying to glorify his own religion in the book. (No, I'm not Catholic) Funny how people see &#34;Catholic&#34; a few times on a page and suddenly they react like someone is trying to convert them.Anywho, there are parts of the book that work. The aliens weren't really a problem for me.  It was interesting-ish albeit slow. (Spoilers follow)  My main issue was with the characterization  of so many characters in this book. Ender has changed into this overly feeling guy. It's like the other extreme of what he was in the first book. I haven't read Ender in Exile yet, maybe that's why it's too sudden of a shift for meI was actually laughing at parts near the end where the author forces Ender and Novina together. It was like a bad soap opera or something. After knowing of the existence of a man for four days, of which you sorta spoke like two times in (both of which were quite hostile), suddenly you're all lovely dovey with him? I mean, wth? And with Ender- you see a picture of a young girl and you instantly fall in love with her and want to raise her babies as your own? And the children after having such a crappy father, after a 15 min conversation with Ender suddenly they see that he is the exact father they have always wanted? It's all just so rushed. People who have been in the situations those kids and that woman have been through need wayyy more time than that before they can learn to trust. Granted kids are prone to trust more easily than adults. It'd be a more normal reaction for them to think, &#34;he speaks the truth but he may being doing it to get something from me.&#34; Rather than living in some fairy land where all your magical dreams can come true. Too much, too soon. This book heavily needed to work on relationship growth. It's too much like a story you'd tell your kids where they all fall in love at first sight and live happily ever after. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I've never seen anything close to that in real life, which makes it lame to come across in a book for grown upsAlso, this book seemed like it needed an editor to cut down on the wordiness. Too wordy and too boring because of itSide note, those long ass names were annoying. They didn't even have much to do with the nicknames they had for most of them. It's like, why write them in?",1.0

Also has a bit of intrigue and hidden plots that keep things interesting. The story teases us with occasional brushes with the Dark, which is the story's version of magic.

Military guys taking orders from a civilian was a stretch even once they gave him &#34;rank&#34;. The idea that people in the current military would murder innocent civilians for some political agenda I also found hard to swallow. It seemed insulting and I found it hard to accept them as the enemy. I'm a libertarian so don't read that as I trust the government. I don't. If the story had black SUVs full of DHS troops pulling up I would have totally been on board. I also didn't like how the main character was some sort of superhero but prior to this was a normal guy.",3.0

8388,"Cold Sassy Tree grabbed me early on.  Of course, it took me a bit into the book to discern whether the &#34;storyteller&#34; was male or female!  The book was told in the vernacular of the times in Cold Sassy Tree, Georgia, 1906.  This was a time when automobiles were just beginning to be owned in small towns; when lots of home still had to go out to the privy and till had gas lights.  But a new day was dawning and along with it, in Cold Sassy Tree, Will Tweedy told its story with much love and humor.This work was a low-key page-turner.  I was surprised that i found myself not wanting to stop reading.I saw that there is a sequel, &#34;Leaving Cold Sassy&#34; and because of my Kindle, I was able to order it and begin reading immediately following the end of &#34;Cold Sassy Tree&#34;.When I complete a book, if I find i can't wait to read the next book by the same author, I know the book just finished was a favorite.

8390,"SUSANNA'S DREAM by Marta Perry is a delightful Inspirational Fiction set in Pleasant Valley, PA. #2 in &#34;The Lost Sisters of Pleasant Vally&#34;, but can be read as a stand alone. Although, I would recommend reading Book 1 also. See, &#34;Lydia's Hope&#34;.&#34;As Young girls, three Amish sisters were separated and told nothing about one another. When the long-held secret of their parentage came to light many years later. Two of the grown women reconnected. Now they reach out to the third.&#34;This is Susanna Bitler's story. Her life is in turmoil, a long held family secret is about to be revealed that could destroy her, two sisters-she didn't know she had, is about to reveal themselves,the woman she thought and mourns for, she is soon to learn, is not her biological Mother. A heart wrenching tale, that will stay with you long after the last page, but a very compelling and loving tale of the bond between sisters. An Amish lovers dream. A very enjoyable read. I would recommend to Amish lovers, and anyone who enjoys a sweet, tale that could either destroy one sister, or bring them all together. First, Susanna must face her own fears. Loved it! Well done!!

8392,"Well, it&#8217;s nearly impossible not to admire Lady Skye&#8217;s determination and cunning.  The heroine of Nicole Jordan&#8217;s Secret of Seduction is what makes this book so enjoyable. She is sweet but a little stubborn too. She knows exactly what she wants and it is the Earl of Hawkhurst who catches her entire  being.  Skye just knows they are meant to be together and she sees beyond his outward scars and realizes he needs her just as much as she needs him.  She must be smart about her plans to catch him though; she knows he is almost betrothed so her desire to be his bride must stay hidden.Lady Skye does hatch a very good plan so they can spend time together, she needs someone to help find her uncle&#8217;s long lost love.  Since Hawk is a member of the Guardian of the Swords, he has unique contacts and abilities and he is the perfect person to find the missing woman.Hawk is a noble and above all loyal hero.  He has a duty to the Guardians and he is very willing to marry the Guardian Master&#8217;s chosen bride since he has no desire to experience love again.  His wife and child were killed by a fire years earlier and he has not forgotten nor forgiven himself over their deaths.  In many ways he feels unworthy to experience happiness and love again but Skye has brought sunlight and laughter back into his life and he begins a romance that thaws his heart but also causes real turmoil.  He finds himself torn between honor and love.Nicole Jordan writes beautiful prose and her characters are fully developed.  I liked everyone in this novel including Skye&#8217;s uncle and her aunt.  This novel is wonderfully romantic and the two leads are affectionate and kind to one another.  A sure keeper",5.0

The way they chose to not be friends with Skylar was TO HURT. Like malevolent fiends they cut and stabbed Skylar 30-60 times in a frenzy of evil.  The cover of darkness and being in a secret place made them feel invinceable. Power over a living human being fueled a rush of glittery excitement.  It wasn't rage, but the emotion of power in the same space as softness and weakness and Skylars vulnerability that drove the madness for 4 hours.""And this the test by which men are judged: the light has come into the world and men have more love for the darkness than for the light because their acts are evil.  The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear his acts will be exposed. But he whose life is true comes to the light."" John 3:19-21.

Anna especially seems gifted in doing so with one success story already under her crisp white apron!I love this Amish community and am thrilled to be back in their homes, and around their farms. This time Arden from Sugarcreek, the Grandson, is now staying with and helping his Grandparents. When you hear that Arden has been arrested at least three times, and probably should have been more, you will wonder what kind of an Amish boy he is? Now gossip can be deceiving, and Arden has the local Amish Grapevine working overtime. What it all comes down to is his love of all living things, including trees, which accounts for one of his arrests.Enter Lily Eichner who has been hired by Anna, she is at it again, to help her, and puts her right in front of Arden every day. There is a big problem to their relationship, that grapevine has reached Lily&#8217;s Dad, and he wants no part of Arden, and actually has already picked out a husband for her, the Bishop&#8217;s son, Tyler Yoder. Now you want to dislike Tyler, but he is so loveable, I couldn&#8217;t, the guy is so nice to everyone.There is another loveable character in this story, Pilot, a humongous dog, and a big kisser with his wet tongue.

8422,"I downloaded this book primarily because it was free, I read the blurb and was intrigued but a couple of things held me back firstly, it was a series and I'm already locked in to so many that I'm reluctant to start another, so I decided before reading that the bar was set very high on this one and I would only continue if it was in fact really good. The second thing that held me back and this I know is going to sound stupid but here goes....the good reviews, I noticed originally that none of them said Amazon verified purchase, this in itself doesn't mean anything I know I'm working my way through loads of iTunes vouchers so I often get books from there but I've been caught out a lot recently by fake reviews so it did make me stop and wonder, this is not the case here I will add.Anyway I started reading and was hooked, it's not dissimilar to a The Hunger Games in a lot of ways, that's not to say it's a copy or ripoff because it's not, this is very much it's own book. The female lead is a sixteen year old girl with no name she, like many others wears a collar or Halo around her neck to control emotions, she's trained to fight, it's all she's ever known and yes she fights to the death and feels nothing while doing it.This book is about this girl who becomes known as Kit and what happens when after feeling nothing for sixteen years she's suddenly bombarded by emotions and feelings, she's no idea what they are and how to cope with them, on top of this she finds herself in a new place where everything is different, or so it seems, it may actually have more similarities than she originally thought. There are times when Kit makes silly decisions and acts immature but it's easy to forget that's she's only sixteen and has spent sixteen years feeling nothing, as a reader I had to remind myself of this several times and ultimately only once did she make a promise and find herself in the debt of someone she really doesn't want to be in this position with and I'm really hoping, fingers crossed that the author doesn't use this 'yes' for what I think she will.So now it looks like I've added another series to my increasingly long list.",4.0
8423,"This book is published by Amazon - so I was surprised at the clunky writing. The manuscript cried out for an editor who could have removed some of the cliches and the profusion of needless adjectives and adverbs. Of course, no editor could have breathed much life into the wooden characters and stilted dialogue - but that's another issue.The quality of the writing shows itself early when we learn that one character has &#34;dread etched on his face,&#34; and another &#34;burned with curiosity&#34; while a third has a mouth &#34;frozen in a crooked half smile&#34; and for a fourth, &#34;anger coursed through his body.&#34; A young girl writes in her diary that &#34;Virginie respects that which is haram or forbidden.&#34; Kind of the diarist to explain.I have to admit I did not get through this long slog set in Egypt in 1919 and 1940.

He decides to take a journey to the Shadowmyst Island and, with help of two very friendly goblins, he goes on an adventure of his life. Ethan on the other hand is constantly fighting against some very scary creatures that are dangerous to the entire kingdom.This is the first book in a series so the author does a very good job of introducing the characters and the world to us. It brings some resemblance to the books of Tolkien with the quest and introducing an evil force somewhere in the world but the similarities end there. Mark E. Lein does a fantastic job of bringing his own vision of a magical world. I really liked the creatures called Ash, they are very mysterious and I hope in the next books will be more informations about them.

I guess if you are a hardcore science fiction fan you know some of this, to me every few pages was a revelation as the story of Robert Heinlein's life was given context to me.Things that come to the forefront of what I learned: Heinlein's struggles with his health (I had heard of them but never knew how many he had had); the man's fight for the rights to his own work (especially unauthorized foreign editions); the games played in Hollywood;  his lifestyle at home; his work with blood donor programs; the many trips the Heinleins took; and many more events which maybe I heard of before bu now were given context.I think sometimes we have difficulty separating the life portrayed with the book that reveals it. Heinlein's politics were his politics plain and simple, you may not like them, or may have loved them but that is what they were.It was great to understand and watch how certain ideas came about and eventually became books while others became great might-have-beens. Heinlein struggles at times between illness, well meaning and not so well meaning editors and Hollywood to bring us a body of work that is indeed grand. Well worth the time and effort of any reader interested in the lives of Robert and Virginia Heinlein.",5.0

Along with the author I kept looking for cliff-hangers and smoking guns right up to the end, which was surprising.I did find what I thought was a minor factual error that had no impact on the credibility of the book: [128] "" ... radioactive elements like radon, bismuth [sic], cobalt [sic], nickel [sic], and uranium ..."" Only radon, radium, uranium, thorium and protactinium are naturally occurring radio-nuclei. But man-made radio-nuclei can get into drinking water. I don't want to take anything away from the author - radioactive particles in water leads to long-term health risks.I loved the book, and I recommend reading it. My copy came from the library, but if your library doesn't have a copy, then this is definitely a book to by for your Kindle reader.",5.0

8463,"Lindsey MacDougall is a spirited young woman whose expertise with horses rivals a warrior's skill. Courageous and clever, she serves as a messenger for her clan's warriors and helps an imprisoned warrior, Logan, escape from a brutal captor's dungeon. Despite the dangers they face during a time of rebellion, love blooms between Lindsey and Logan, but as an illegitimate son, Logan believes he can never have the woman he loves for his own.

8465,"Reviewed by JenBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookLet me start out by saying that I love Donna Kauffman. Her writing style and story telling skills just draw me in to the tale and just won&#8217;t let me go. And having read the first book in this series, Sugar Rush, and loving the community she was creating, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get started on Sweet Stuff.This story starts shortly after the Sugar Rush ends and features Riley who made a small appearance in that prior book. And from page one, I was in stitches laughing at Riley&#8217;s klutziness, perhaps because I could totally relate. But it also made her more believable. Yes, she&#8217;s an attractive women. But she&#8217;s also clumsy, not stick thin and a little awkward when it comes to dealing with a man she&#8217;s attracted to. And she&#8217;s also dealing with having been betrayed from her fiancee. As the story progressed, I found myself rooting her on and anxiously awaiting her &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment so we could have our happily ever after.Enter into the picture Riley. He&#8217;s a famous author who has come to this small island community in South Carolina to clear his mind and work on his new novel. Little does he realize that his world is going to be shaken up when he meets Riley. Quinn is your typical romance hero&#8230; you know the type. They&#8217;re rich or famous (or both), quite handsome and sometimes just too good to be true. But that didn&#8217;t stop me from perhaps just falling a little in love with Quinn myself as I read his love story with Riley. His understanding of Riley and her insecurities, but his persistence with her when she&#8217;s keeping him at a distance just had me turning the pages.The plot of this book is really just the romance. There&#8217;s no grand mystery or bad guy in the wings. There are some minor subplots that enhance the story, but Sweet Stuff is all about the character development as they work toward their happily ever after. And I was honored to go along for the ride.As this book is part of the Cupcake Club series, we&#8217;re also treated with a couple recipes for the reader to enjoy. How does Reverse Caramel Apple Cupcakes or Sweet Peach Tea Cupcakes sound?I honestly can&#8217;t wait for the next book in this series, Babycakes, which will be released in October. The book does stand alone, but has characters from Sugar Rush do make appearances in Sweet Stuff, reading the series in order does make the experience a little more enhanced.",4.0

8471,"I downloaded the Kindle book on a free promo and was happily astonished to find an involving, expertly written story. This guy knows how to write in first person and build scenes tangible enough for the reader to stand and look around in.Jacobi's prosthetic is a nifty, er, hook that differentiates him from the ex-cop detective pack. Thanks to Matthews's writing, I believed every move Jacobi made and every thought that he had--and he had plenty of deep ones. The psychic connections and miraculous occurrences at the end kind of came out of left field, but by that time Matthews had me so engrossed in Jacobi's angst that I bought into all of it.P.S.

8472,"The Second Deadly Sin is set in northern Sweden and opens with the hunt for a wounded bear.  When it is finally brought down, the hunters make a grisly discovery. The story then moves to the seemingly disconnected but equally horrific murder of a woman and her missing grandson. Prosecutor Rebecka Martinsson is initially assigned to the case but a less skilled but extremely ambitious rival manages to claim it for himself. Martinsson refuses to take a less important case and instead decides to take her vacation time. However, she can't let it go. She discovers there are threads tying the bear hunt and the murder together and that they may also be linked to other sudden and unexplained deaths.The novel alternates between Martinsson's investigations in the present and the story of the love affair between a young school teacher and an important mining official in the years leading up to WWI and the subsequent unsolved murder of the teacher.  As Martinsson digs deeper, she begins to suspect that these events of the past are somehow related to those in the present and that, if she doesn't solve the case quickly, there will be more deaths.This is the fifth in this series by Swedish author Asa Larsson but it is the first I have read and it worked very well as a standalone. Larsson has a deft hand with descriptions of both time and place. Her forays into the past are very well written and seem likely to be true to the time period including her portrayal of the pre-WWI cultural and class values. The story is both intelligent and suspenseful and, like so many of the thrillers coming out of the Scandinavian countries, very dark.  But it is with her characters where Larsson shines.  She has created a group of memorable characters who are at once sympathetic and flawed and who make us care about what happens to them. Best of all, I never guessed who the murderer was until the big reveal at the end, something that happens too rarely. Definitely a high recommendation from me especially for fans of Nordic Noir.",5.0

8480,"I received a copy via Edelweiss for an honest review.Before I begin writing my review, let me just make this very, very clear for you prospective readers: Lauren Oliver's Panic is NOT a dystopian novel. It is contemporary (set in the present time) and holds a handful of mystery and suspense, but there are not characteristics of it being a dystopian novel.I've found myself on the fence regarding Oliver's writing more than once. While I absolutely loved Before I Fall, which was her debut, I couldn't get through Delirium. As for Panic, I had quite a bit of mixed feelings. While there were moments that made me itch to continue reading the novel, other instances had me physically pushing it away. The pacing is irregular, but still good, and the concept of the novel is fantastic. But like with Delirium (at least for me), I felt like the idea was just a tad too large for Oliver to handle.The earlier stages of the novel were actually good, if not at times confusing, since the narrative tended to deviate from the norm, and I felt like sharing with you guys how I liked what I was reading so far (hence the pictures on my blog.) But as the story reached its halfway point, I started noticing little bits and pieces that were actually a bit annoying. It was so cool to see such intense challenges, and even a few terrifying ones that I couldn't really read because they freaked me out, but I felt like the dramatic subplots overshadowed the premise of the novel.Perhaps one of the most intriguing, and best choices in regards to this novel, was how the narrative was split into two characters, Heather and Dodge. These two personalities clashed on so many levels that I decided to just use it as a way to see how Oliver could manage a male character as opposed to a female character. I'm going to let you in on a little secret that I've come to realize after finishing this novel: Oliver can be great at writing powerful male protagonist with big personalities, but she struggles with the female characters. And before I have some of you telling me, &#34;Oh but being weak is a characteristic in some characters,&#34; being written in a weak fashion does not mean it is a characteristic, it simply means that the character is hard to relate to and/or accept as a trustworthy voice of a story.Heather was, for me, slightly reminiscent of Lena and if you've read my review of Delirium, then you know that's not a good thing for me. Sure, she had a tough life, but she was so frustrating that I almost started yelling at her. Dodge, on the other hand, was a character that had a lot of fire in him. He was daring, almost callous in his descriptions, and I was frankly surprised that Oliver had it in her to introduce such an extreme character. But I liked him and I think he is perhaps one of the saving graces of this novel.The conclusion felt abrupt and a bit too easy. Things were left unfinished and I felt like the story was building up to this huge ending but what I actually got felt a bit lackluster. &#60;SPOILER&#62;Suddenly everything is fixed and everyone is happy? That makes no sense--it's like a chunk of the story was left out. Reality doesn't depict characters suddenly being ok with each other without hashing things out. &#60;/SPOILER&#62;I'm curious to see what Oliver comes up with next. I'm hoping that in the future I'll have the opportunity to read something like Before I Fall again. I loved the near simplicity of how our actions affect not just our lives, but the lives around us. With Panic, it almost felt like it was the creation of someone who was trying a little bit too hard--and if that sounds harsh, I apologize, but I'm upset that something that started out so great, turned into a weird, weak, and confusing mess.I recommend this one for readers looking for a different kind of read. If you like contemporary suspense or mystery, you might like this. The point is, this is my opinion and I am not the voice for every reader. So, while I only enjoyed this a smidgen, others might love this one.",2.0

8505,"An apocalyptic thriller that is revolves around change and catharsis, Rag Men develops like a blizzard; the snow falls slowly at first, but its intensity ratchets up engulfs those who stand witness.Rag Men revolves around the development of two men, Rooster and Ross, who are polar opposites; their stories parallel each other, and the craftsmanship involved in this component is indicative of Rocky Alexander&#8217;s ability to write a compelling story; the characters&#8217; actions and attitudes are presented in stark contrast. We have two different stories in the same timeline, and these stories ultimately converge, as the reader would expect.The zombie scenario serves as the catalyst behind character development. We have your disaster scenario and the coping mechanisms of a population, though it&#8217;s reduced to a microcosm through the perspectives of two characters. Ross represents the moral dissolution that may be required to survive in such a scenario, while Rooster represents the chaos itself. There is a lot of depth in these characters, and further discussing their metamorphosis would spoil the novel.There are plenty of scenes that include graphic violence and some disgusting truths. Rocky Alexander provided several moments were survival skills and a degree of common sense betrayed an amount of painstaking care that was applied to this story. Fans of apocalyptic-survival scenarios will find plenty to love here. The zombies themselves are a serious threat; the amount of detail used to describe them heightens the tension, especially when Alexander uses the plague/germ idea to indicate that everything and anything can be dangerous.Ross&#8217;s iron will and determination made him a compelling character, especially during the unforgettable trek through a wintry land. We have the symbolic battle against nature in addition to an unnatural phenomenon, which nicely fits the two personalities that define this book.An excellent tale of survival horror that that will stick with you long after the story has ended.",5.0

One day, he asks her a special favor: go back in time, via his own invention, and change his destiny; a destiny that lands him in a wheelchair.How can she deny him this one thing? Her adventure back is eye-opening. Everything she thought she understood about their life together is upended.Time travel is a tricky subject. No matter how well explained it is, the potential paradox problems are too often glaring. So it takes a good story to make the reader forget all of that. Thus is the case here. I was caught up in Claudia and Adam's love story. What began as a light story quickly became more complex: some things are simply meant to happen, no matter how much we think changing them would improve our lives.Claudia is an endearing character; she's hurting from unfulfilled expectations--she thought she'd be a wife and mother by now--and fighting to get back what she thinks she's lost. Adam, who at first seems distant, comes full circle through the revelations of time travel. Thanks to strong emotions, it develops into a sweet (just the right amount, not overly sweet) romance.If you enjoy a romance with an interesting twist, I recommend The Time Traveler's Boyfriend.Note: I received a complimentary copy for review purposes.

Always fun-filled, full of action, and loaded with real down-to-earth characters, these books are ones I always look forward to reading.Stephanie is still bounty hunting for her cousin Vinnie.  She enjoys her job, but feels she is getting nowhere in her career.  Stephanie wonders if it may be time to hang up her stun gun and hand cuffs for a different type of employment.  She also feels the same way about the two men in her life, Joe Morelli and Ranger.  While she feels as if she is 'practically engaged' to Joe, neither of them can make a commitment to each other and prefer to just keep exclusively dating.  However, Stephanie has the hots for Ranger -- as do all of the women who lay eyes on him -- and the two worlds tend to collide.Murder is involved in this book -- elderly women are being found in dumpsters and Ranger is devoted to finding out who is responsible.  Of course, Stephanie is dragged into the scenario and chaos, action, and fun abound. Then there are the bounty hunting situations that are always fun and different.  The entire gang is back -- Grandma -- who is always hysterical -- Lula -- who is also always hysterical -- Morelli, Ranger, Vinnie, Connie, and a host of new characters that will leave you laughing.  Even though you pretty much know where the road is going, the journey is fun and worth the read.My only wish -- along with others -- is that Stephanie would make a decision regarding the men in her life.  However, I personally feel that this choice will not happen until the last installment of these books.  Makes me wonder how many more books in this series Evanovich has up her sleeve.I definitely will be along for the ride.  I love the characters, the situations, the dialogue, and everything about these books.  They are light, easy to enjoy and read, and just down right fun.  Yes, they are repetitive, yes, they are pretty much the same old same old -- but to me, this is life as it truly is.

8514,"This is an endearing tale of two brothers who just want to have a day of fun. Being the children of an alcoholic father places them at a disadvantage in society, through no fault of their own. Bette Stevens explores unspoken and often hidden prejudices that pervade society. Though the story is set in the 1950&#8217;s, one can still relate to the experiences that the two boys go through, as they still exist today. Look around you, there is poverty, bullying and misery marring our world. So, really nothing much has changed since then.Pure Trash is a heartbreaking story of innocence stolen, as the children do not understand the reasons for people&#8217;s attitude towards them.

The book separated from the cover the second time I opened it, and now I read it gingerly for fear that more pages will separate. That said, the pages and photos are huge and breathtaking. It has been an engaging book for both the kids and adults in our house. It would be a beautiful coffee table book too. It is well worth the money, but splurge for the hardcover.",4.0

8527,"I was really in the mood for a paranormal/angel story and this book sounded like a good one, so I gave it a chance. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book, but there doesn't seem to be much of a paranormal story line, other than a few of the characters. Nothing seems to happen except for everything that she is going through in her school life. Grace is also hard to like, in my opinion. She does have a good side, but she is overly dramatic and has a bit of a temper problem that comes in the strangest of places. A lot of times she gets so angry over such a minor detail it just doesn't really make sense. I have to say though, I haven't finished reading the book entirely, I'm about 80% of the way through..and still waiting for the paranormal aspect to come through. For example (possible spoiler alert), her powers. We know that she is basically an empath when she touches someone, but that's it? Are there more powers? I would think there would be because of who she is..same with Quinten, what about his powers? And, Darius? Who is Darius? We don't learn enough about the other characters. The entire book seems to be about Grace, her drama and her friends. It's worth reading if you're not trying to read a book about angels, but if you are, you may want to find another book. All of that being said, I will finish it and I may read the sequel..with the hope that paranormal aspect will be brought out in the second book.",3.0

I guess because I love the Canterbury Tales and the supernatural aspect of these novels makes them different from the excellent Hugh Corbett books.  The downside is that, with so many irons in the fire, they come out irregularly and may never be wrapped up.  If so, that is unfortunate, but doesn't keep the individual novels, which all stand alone rather well, from being well written and enjoyable.  I also heartily recommend his Egyptian series.",5.0

8539,"Daisies are Forever by Liz Tolsma is a historical fiction written during WWII. What drew me to the book in the first place was the beautiful cover art. Then I read the description.... and it drew me in to the story.I have to admit... this was a hard book for me to read.  First, I think it was because I don't know my history as well as I should and so, quite a bit of the information was new to me.  Second, it was hard because sometimes the story was just confusing.  The main character, Gisela, was the one telling the story, but sometimes... I just could understand what she was trying to say or how what she was saying fit into the story.  Also, some of the dialog seemed stale... it had no real emotion or creativity to it.  There was also an overall lack of God mentioned.  I was surprised by this on the one hand, but because of things I have recently heard from different authors, not at all surprised as it seems that publishing companies want authors to &#34;tone down&#34; the &#34;christianese&#34; and biblical references in their books so they can reach more people.  Given that knowledge, the book works... it still has a Christian thread, but not so overwhelming and in-your-face that it would turn most people off.Overall, the story is beautiful and sad with a somewhat happy ending (it was WW2, of course, there was sadness).  Gisela and Mitch are both brave, but circumstances often force them to question the decisions they make in the heat of necessity. They are drawn to each other as their journey continues, but there are stumbling blocks along the way -- fear, Kurt and Audra, and uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, they each find the faith they need and with it the hope they need to survive the world at its darkest hour.",4.0

The storyline was different but I liked the author's plot, I wish there had been more world building - if this continues as a series, it should be very enjoyable.Captain Willis Tayte us the leader of a group of Nion Warriors who patrol in space. They are from a superior planet and are responsible for seeing that races from other planets don't hurt or imprison, species from other worlds. On a routine mission they capture a ship piloted by Ben Objure a species that capture others to sell or even eat. After incapacitating the Ben Objure they look for prisoners and find a humanoid man who is chained and kept in horrible conditions, After freeing the captive they realize the ship is set to explode. Willis protects the prisoner at the risk of her own life.When they return to their ship, the search is on to find out who Vall is - that's the only name they can find for the man.Good premise, well written - I don't remember any grammatical errors.

8548,"Great debut! Rated 4.5 stars.Lots of drama for such a little town. The author seems genuine, getting the nuances right regarding the characters and the environment. (Not that I would know really, but it sounds real!) This book explores the pressures of family (the weight of blood) and how it influences your reactions and choices. A lot of aggravation could be solved if they would only talk to each other truthfully -- as my grandfather always says, &#34;there's no communication&#34;. It's a sad book that's written well. A certain important scene was very disturbing. I look forward to more books from this author.PS: I know it's a tiny town, but do women really still (in the 1990s)not get prenatal care from an OB and deliver at home? Why didn't Lila go to a hospital? Nobody in this book goes to a real doctor. Why don't people get air conditioners? And have you ever seen teens without cell phones?

8569,"This is the first read for me by this author, she hasn't written that many books but she's certainly very talented. This story set in the twelfth century is a tale of love, murder and betrayal. Robert de Langley the Lion of Normandy is determined to regain his lands and properties back from a Norman knight William Montagne. While William is off to meet the king Robert takes his chance, and pretending to be delivering supplies he gains entrance to the castle which very quickly falls to him. Williams youngest daughter Jocelyn is brave and not the slightest bit afraid to stand up to Robert. Her two siblings Brian and Adelise are older. But Brian is with their father. Adelise although older and considered more beautiful than the dark and exotic Jocelyn, is reduced to constant bouts of crying leaving Jocelyn to deal with the invaders alone.Jocelyn had never been her fathers favourite, she was the child of his much despised second wife. In fact he treats Jocelyn little better than a servant. She's attracted to Robert, but when King Stephen hears of the escalating trouble he arrives and pronounces a solution. Robert will marry William's eldest daughter. But Adelise is horrified and runs away. So Robert is forced to marry Jocelyn.While this is really well researched and written, it's meant to be a romance and to a degree it is. But the author seems more preoccupied with the historical details happening at that period in history and the fight for the throne of England between King Stephen and Henry of Anjou (the future Henry II). I did like the two main characters  but any problems between them were to quickly glossed over SPOILER...... Shortly after their marriage while Robert is staying elsewhere Jocelyn arrives and finds another woman in his bed. His excuse given to Jocelyn was  &#34;she was there and she was attractive, but I only thought about you&#34; the matter was immediately forgotten, really! It was things like that I didn't like.

8581,"The book cover and title are magnificent, the contents are not.  While readers who are new to the NYC culture will find the general details in the book somewhat interesting, I suspect that the more seasoned ones will conclude otherwise. I was drawn in by the possibility of receiving a broad understanding of what goes on in the ""underground economy"" of NY. Instead what I got was a narrow synopsis of the author's interaction with a few people in the world of drugs, prostitution, and porn videos.Though the author notes at the end of the book that this is just his memoir, the contents lack a lot of things that a reader would want to know- general information on the history of the NY underground, some stats on what the underground really consists of, greater details on the wealth/poverty divide, etc). Instead what we get is prolonged details of shallow events and conversations. The book seems more like one that (as the author implies a few times) was meant to keep him busy with a project at a difficult time in his life.One element that I felt uncomfortable with throughout the book was the author's statement that he needed to be non judgmental when interacting with the underworld. Odd to use ones profession and academia as a crutch when the kinds of activities that the people he interacts with are destructive to self and society. How does one walk away from human interactions like this as if it were an experiment/analysis conducted in a lab? Should one even do such experiments/analysis? Undoubtedly his work will inspire others to pursue the same line of investigation. But I would suggest that this is best left to the NYPD who surely have a much deeper grasp of the NY underworld and whose purpose is much more nobler - the maintenance of law and order in Gotham. Maybe the NYPD should write a book on the NY underground!",2.0

8609,"I read this book for a book club. I love the cover and thought the idea was one that could have real insight into a troubled boy's journey through unfortunate circumstances. Instead, I could care less about this boy and found him and his loser friend, Boris, annoying. The inner monologues that go on for way too many paragraphs, found me skipping forward many times. Then the plot, which could have has some interesting twists, instead plodded...PLODDED...along until the outcome became pretty much what I anticipated.

8621,"Orange Blossom, A Flowering Novel, Sarah Daltry.Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviews.I loved Jack and Lily in the first two Flowering novels, they'd been through so much drama and despair, and finally found happiness together, so its was great to catch up and see how they were getting on in their lives.As always there are problems, that's real life isn't it &#8211; it's not some sweet world full of rainbows and gold coins...but one where even with the best of intentions life gets in the way. Jack's on the home stretch of studying while Lily still has a couple of years to go, and they're wondering where they go from here. Whatever happens they want a future together but then Life throws that spanner in. Poor Jack &#8211; something happens that's a nightmare for him and spirals him into despair again, and Lily and Alana need to help him get back out of his depression. Its something they've all feared with Jack's history and it has a huge impact on all of them.This is really sensitively done and handled. Having been in a similar depression in the past I can relate to the musings on suicide. Falling from a height &#8211; con= may not die but just end up worse off. Drowning = tough to do, takes time. Drugs = which ones,  how many, and would it again leave worse off from other damage if failed. Bleeding = needs clear action and takes time. All these thoughts are familiar to anyone depressed, and when they crop up in the book they make it feel so so real.Lily, she's so in love but struggles to help Jack, but is determined she won't let him down. She loves him and just wants to help him work through this and be with her. He's convinced he's not good enough, and she needs to make him understand he's all she wants. I felt for her, so upset in this book over things she couldn't control.Its not all doom and gloom though, but shows how to shine a light through that darkness and follow it. Its a perfect ending and I look forward to the next book with them in, Ambrosia.Stars: Four and a half. Tough, gritty read at times, real life, real drama but thankfully real love too and that wins through.ARC supplied by author",4.0

8629,"4 Stars~arc was given to me in exchange for an honest review~Knox:&#34;Wasn't there some saying about never trust a skinny chef? Well, never trust a beautiful sex-addiction counselor either. Or perhaps it was that I didn't trust myself around her.&#34;Let me start out by saying, WOW what a freaking cliffhanger. I mean come on really? I will definitely be reading book two for sure. When I break follows the love story of Knox and McKenna. Knox is a sex addict, though he won't really admit it. He is basically mandated to go to counseling for his problem. McKenna is leading her first group of sex addicts. When these two meet it's like a bolt of electricity ignites. The connection between them both is instant. Know seriously gives me butterflies, he doesn't love a bad boy that needs to be saved?McKenna:&#34;The crazy thing was, when I was near Knox that painful ache in my chest vanished. It was like his presence alone had some strange impact on me. I could stop worrying and planning my next move. I could just be. It was a feeling of total relief. Maybe the craziness of his life balanced out own.&#34;Our hero and heroine both have experienced great loss and heartache in their lives. They actually need one another more than they realize. This book was beautiful written. It is in both character's POV, which is one of my favorites because we get to swim inside both of our main character's brains. I love Knox and his love for his brothers. McKenna is a constant do-gooder. She is always helping and saving people which is admirable. She is a very likable person. This book was super easy to get into and it was a quick read. I just was not happy with the ending, but hey at least we are getting a second book!",4.0

I like the lead, and watching the developing dynamic with his ""sidekick""... and the herbalist (sorry, I'm not good at remembering names) adds a touch of medieval CSI! However, if whodunnits are the modern-day version of medieval morality plays, this one teaches a sadly realistic lesson about the difficulty of achieving full, true justice. Also, the secondary mystery, about the child-killer, barely progresses past the prologue stage in this installment.

8632,"I read this story in a few hours, so it is very short.  It also feels very rushed and the progression of events does not feel right.  That is probably my biggest issue with this read.  I enjoyed the book, but I wanted more.  The story needed more.  I loved the h and H.  Two amazing characters.  I felt the love for them.  The content is disturbing, as the warning says.  The h is taken, gang raped, beaten, tortured, disfigured and other things are done to leave her for dead.  I will say this...I was glad the author did not give us it as it was happening.  I didn't want that detailed.  What we do learn about what happened to her was horrific, but the author gave it to us in pieces.  I was glad she did it that way.  The h is just one strong, amazingly determined woman.  The H, her doctor, was an amazing man.  Wow, we all need a Dominic.  I guessed the twists as soon as the other characters were introduced.  Therefore, it was not a big twist for me.  It was predictable.  This story had the potential, for me, to be a 5* read.  It needed to be longer to let it progress in an appropriate manner.  The relationships needed to be built more slowly.  The other conflicts needed more attention.  The epilogues for each convicted assailant was interesting, but I felt it was not enough of me seeing justice for the h.  I especially wanted to see what happened to the &#34;ring leader.&#34;  I also wanted to see some of the beautiful moments from the H and H in the epilogue in a bit more detail.  Again, I enjoyed this read.  If it were a little longer, more detailed, and more developed it would have been a home run.",3.0

8645,"Being an avid reader, it is rare that a book's story arc takes me by surprise. In Jasinda Wilder's outstanding Alpha, I found an exception.Alpha was riveting, captivating, enchanting and sexy. I was enthralled and spellbound from beginning to end because of the originality of plot, the character development, pacing, and the sizzling sex scenes that were truly masterpieces.Written in first person in the heroine's POV, time was taken to establish the intellectual, emotional and physical draw between the Valentine Roth and Kyrie St Claire. Thereby making the attraction credible and completely believable. I love that Wilder took time to establish that, all the while providing tantalising sensual tension. Her books are downright sexy, but it's not all about the sex. Alpha was all about the journey to love against the odds. The impossible relationship possible. Not a neatly tied bow of sunshine & roses. Two untrusting, isolated souls finding completion, trust, connection.You will love the characters. You will love the strength of the heroine, her intellect, her natural charm and beauty, her intuitive nature, all untarnished by her dilapidated life circumstances. And the sensationally sexy Hero? I loved the man, and not just his exceptionally talented tongue. Cough. (Even the first kisses will leave you breathless.) His intensity, his charm, his patience, his passion for Kyrie, his humble arrogance, which I know sounds obscure, but that was Roth. He was untrusting, yet devoted: a contradiction. The pairing? Shouldn't make sense, but they did. True compatibility.I now have another favourite Jasinda Wilder chapter. Chapter 10. Chapter 10 of Alpha. Wow. Mind you, then there was 11 & 12...And then the twist. Of all the scenarios I'd imagined, the actual incident was unexpected. But it was also handled so well; intelligently, logically, credibly.This was a book I would read again. In fact, I read it twice before this review. Completely enamoured. Make sure you wait for the bonus scene at the end. Not. To. Be. Missed. Yum.Thank you Mrs Wilder for a skilfully constructed story, a breathtaking escape from reality, believable, wonderful characters, and erotic, jaw-dropping schmexy. To readers: Enjoy devouring Alpha.",5.0

8649,"Rose is a typist in the local police precinct. It is 1923, and Rose records testimonies that no women should have to hear.  With Rose's background as a orphan, being raised by nuns, and having to work hard for everything she has, she takes nothing for granted and follows all the rules of society.  That is until Odalie, the new typist at the precinct walks into her life.  Odalie lives in a fancy hotel, has men falling at her feet, and gets everything she wants with a wink of her eye.  Rose immediately falls under Odalie's spell and their friendship turns Rose into someone she no longer recognizes.Now, I have to stop here, after my brief synopsis of the book and tell you that I did not finish the book.  I tried.  I gave it several hours and days.  I got to Chapter 9 and page 130 and I just couldn't go any farther. This doesn't happen to me very often because I really feel like I am a pretty good judge of &#34;book character&#34;. But, this one just didn't do it for me.  I was bored and felt like I was forced to read.  I have a &#34;rule&#34; that if I'm not enjoying my reading, I need to quit the book because I have too many other books to read.So, with that in mind, I can only offer you that hundreds of other people have LOVED this book. There are rave reviews for THE OTHER TYPIST. There are also several others who have felt the same way I did.  But, as a book blogger, I am not going to lie or tell you that I liked something when I didn't. It just didn't work for me.Some things I did like though were the author's character descriptions.  I had no trouble imagining Rose or Odalie, the Sergeant or the Lieutenant Detective, or Dotty and Helen from the boarding house where Rose lived.  Rindell's details of the 1920's, the expectations of women, and descriptions of those trying to break out of those expectations depicted an era that showed how difficult it was for Rose to find a way to fit in.  Even though I couldn't find a way to be interested in the story, I found several quotes from the book that I enjoyed.If it were not for the fact that they need so much typing done and cannot do it themselves, there would be no women employed at all. The typewriter is indeed my passport into a world otherwise barred to me and my kind.  Page 3So it's strange to me that with Odalie, I suddenly found myself breaking the rules I had once held in such precious regard....The thing about rules is that when you break one, it is only a matter of time before you break more, and the severe architecture that once protected you is destined to come crashing down about your ears.  Pages 119-120THE OTHER TYPIST has also been optioned for film produced by and starring Keira Knightley. I would actually be interested in seeing the movie.",1.0

8663,"This review applies to &#34;Space Vengeance&#34;, book three in the Scrapyard Ship series as read on Kindle.In my previous review on &#34;Hab 12&#34;, I indicated the Author was vacillating entirely too much between actual &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; and Fantasy, and should tighten-up his story-telling; this he has failed to do, and in fact has grown worse.&#34;Science&#34; entails the study of known, provable phenomena; whereas &#34;fantasy&#34; does not. &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; postulates scientifically POSSIBLE phenomena which does not yet exist, but may at some point in the future should our scientific knowledge make it so. Too much of what Mr. McGinnis puts forth as &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; is actually &#34;fantasy&#34; since the known laws of science make it impossible. Entertaining fantasy, but NOT &#34;Sci-Fi&#34;.Additionally, I am left to wonder how much (if any) actual military experience Mr. McGinnis has. I am sure that I am not the only veteran who laughed at the ridiculously naive ideas the Author displays as to how the military, especially the Naval branches, work.When you couple the above mentioned military ignorance with his obvious left-wing political bias, which he really makes apparent in this book, you have one man's fantasy about a world and &#34;multiverses&#34; he wished could exist, but never has or will. I mean really... The &#34;Montana Militia&#34; backing a rogue FEMALE Admiral's attempted coup to overthrow the government?!  Laughably ridiculous! The Author seems to know even less about militia groups (especially that one), than he does about the US military! Such propaganda narratives are blown apart by the simple fact that it has been the Leftist extremist groups such as &#34;Red Flag&#34;, the &#34;Weathermen&#34;, and the so-called &#34;People's Liberation&#34; armies of men like Mao, Lenin, and Castro, who throughout history  have been responsible for the bloodiest coups in man's history. How many violent coups have the American militia groups ever attempted? ZERO. How many have Leftist? Numerous.I think it despicable when Writers of a genre of literature, which should be safe from political propaganda use it as a pulpit to propagate their own twisted mis-characterizations. Mr. McGinnis - If your readers want to entertain a political treatise, there are much better source Authors they could resort to. I, like so many others, buy Sci-Fi books seeking a temporary escape from such ugly real-world  concerns. It violates the whole intent of such escapist literature to inject your own political biases into it, much like defecating in the swimming pool; and soon you'll find good folks electing to swim elsewhere.You want to air your views on politics? Fine, but do it within that genre where it may be properly critiqued as such, and rebutted by others.Finally, whereas the Author seems to be a Leftist in other respects, he certainly embraces capitalism where his own financial interests are concerned. These books are becoming thinner (both literally and figuratively) with every issue, and it does seem that the Author is attempting to &#34;milk it&#34; for all he can. No &#34;Tolkein&#34; is he, for sure.I was probably a sucker to buy his third installment in the vain hopes that things would improve; they haven't. So, this will be my last purchase from this Author.I hope others will find this review helpful.",1.0

I like how the reader learns new things along the way as the character does and it doesn't just tell you what's happening and then tell you what happens to the character. So basically I liked this book HEAPS it was very exiting and never failed to add new problems and twists.,5.0

We get lots of information about what's going on with the medallions, her son's weird abilities, and the &#34;demon&#34; inside her.  Even better, she seems to be resolving the romantic issues.  Don't get me wrong, cheating is usually a deal breaker for me, but Kingsley's redeemed himself pretty well by risking his life for her multiple times since she dumped him.  And Fang should be making her skin crawl, not debating whether or not she still loved him.  Just ewww.. The case was pretty obvious but nonetheless entertaining.

8685,"I really enjoyed this one.  One, because we got to see little Vinny (the young teenager Nico was trying to save in Worth the Fight) all grown up.  And two, because Vinny was hard not to love...controlling, dominating fighter with his issues and all.Liv and Vinny have history.  Seven years ago, in high school, she was the brainiac girl who tutored Vinny in English.  He always seemed to have a girl on his arm, but soon his attention turned to her.  Liv loved Vinny's attention and thought they had something, but he walked away and broke her heart.  So imagine her surprise when she discovers her assignment from the newspaper she's interning at is to interview a hot MMA star...Vince.  They do a good job of reconnecting, but then Vince's past plays it hand and causes the two of them to fight for  their relationship.I loved Liv.  There was just something about the bookworm, wallflower type getting the hot, alpha male everyone else wants that made me happy.  She struggled with her feelings for Vinny, because she was so afraid she was going to get her heart broken again, but she threw caution to the wind because being with Vinny made her happy.  And then you felt badly for her when she was put in the ugly position to write the story about the Senator that was going to hurt Vinny so badly.  Her emotions, her turmoil leapt off the pages at you and made you want to put your arms around her and tell her it's going to to be ok.Vinny was everything you'd want a hot, sexy, MMA fighting alpha male to be.  He was dominant and could urke the hell out of you, but he had a sweet, protective side that made you want to be the one Vinny stood on guard for.  But Vinny had his own set of issues.  His drug addict mother continues to cause his life to be one step away from disaster, even when he's trying to keep himself on the straight and narrow.  You feel for him and understand why he can't walk away from the only parent he's ever known, but there comes a point when you want him to do just that and think about himself and what he needs.Vi Keeland is fast becoming one of those authors on my auto-buy list.  She creates these wonderful characters that are so easy to connect with...even with all their issues.  Couple that with engaging storylines and you find it very hard to put your e-reader down.  If you haven't read one of her books before, definitely pick up WORTH THE CHANCE.  It's worth your time to take a look.",4.0
8686,"First and foremost, this was one of those books where I started it, set it aside without finishing, formed my opinion on how I thought it was going to be. I then got the idea to buy it for my husband since it has many things he likes from movies - cars, action, international intrigue and espionage. Now, my husband isn't an avid reader. He's got many a hobby, books are probably the last thing on his list of &#34;fun things&#34; (he's slowly crossing over to the good side, though). For him to pick it up and do a marathon reading of it, and then to encourage me to finish it made me think I was too hasty to set it aside. At his urging, I started it again and have never been more surprised. This book was definitely worlds better than the preconceived notions I had for it. I normally don't fancy books with non-stop action and stories where the characters jump continents on what seems like a never-ending chase. Now I can throw that idea out the window and expand my horizons because it turns out I do like them :)Lucas Soul is an immortal, a half-breed. A product of his parents' forbidden relationship. His father descends from the Crovirs, his mother from the Bastians. The Crovirs and the Bastians are the only immortals on earth, and they have been fighting for millennia. Hunters are tasked with finding the half-breeds and killing them. Most of them don't last long, Lucas being the exception. He's also hunted for another reason - he is feared because of a certain &#34;gift&#34; he possesses. Lucas now resides in Boston, running a PI company with his partner, Reid. Reid is a former Marine and a former cop, and one of the few humans who know truly what Lucas is.The story starts immediately with action. Lucas dies his 15th death, which isn't a good thing. The immortals aren't completely immortal after all. They can only survive up to 17 deaths before they are gone for good. Lucas and Reid now embark on an international chase, running from both hunters and dangerous men who are also after the same thing they are.I loved the idea of immortals actually having a mortal side. I suppose that as long as they're careful, they can live long and prosper. Lucas isn't careful. I also love the bits of history woven into the story. Starrling based many of her events on factual historical events, and you can tell she took great care to properly research different aspects and pull together a great story. I also loved the action. In the beginning, I found the action to be a bit tedious. It seemed like Lucas and Reid were running for no purpose. Had I initially continued just a bit further, I would have learned a bit more of the how's and why's they are on an wild goose chase that leads them from several cities in the US over to Europe.I really enjoyed this story after giving it a second chance. I would have surely been missing out if I went with my initial thoughts on the book and decided not to finish it at all. I will now be on the lookout for anything else Ms. Starrling publishes.**Book received on behalf of the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion.",5.0

8689,"(3 & 1/2 stars)There are many things to admire about author Donnie Eichar and his work in writing Dead Mountain.  It is a kind of &#34;cold case&#34; forensics saga, as Eichar set out to solve the half-century-old mystery of what happened to an experienced of college students who were experienced hikers but somehow all perished in the &#34;Dyatlov Pass Incident.&#34;  The book alternates between chapters describing the author's expeditions to Russia to retrace the hikers' trip and his attempts to figure out why they died, and chapters telling about the 1959 Dyatlov trip and the official investigation immediately following the group's disappearance.  All of it is relatively interesting, but the sense of mystery is sapped out of the story by too much detail about Eichar's research steps and methodology.  Then, the hiker's part of the story never gets very compelling until the last chapter, which is Eichar's speculative reconstruction of the hiker's final hours, including what happened to them and how it happened.There isn't much wrong with Mr. Eichar's writing style, which is well suited to the tale he tells.  He incorporates moments of humor, and does a moderately good job of capturing the different personalties of the hikers (although, strangely, the leader of the group, Igor Dyatlov, for whom the pass was later named, seems almost invisible throughout much of the book!).  Perhaps Eichar's greatest enemy in writing a memorable book about the Incident is that there was really only enough strong material for a fantastic magazine article, but not for an entire book.  I don't think there's much the author could do about that situation, although some editing and focus issues contributed to the problem.",3.0

8700,"First, let me say, I enjoyed this book.  Its not my favorite, but I have no problems admitting I cried quite a bit the last 25%.  And I like books that make me feel.  So that's a plus.But if you read Slammed and Hopeless by Colleen Hoover, very little about this book will be new to you.  I'm not sure if it was intentional, and it's not my place to assume it was.  As a friend of mine says, &#34;there are only so many story lines, eventually a couple of books are going to resemble each other.&#34;  That's true, but I have a laundry list of similarities that I won't post here as to avoid spoilers.  There were at least a dozen times that I found myself saying, &#34;Wait....that's from Slammed&#34;.  Or &#34;Wait...that happened in Hopeless&#34;.  It disappointed me that the true originality didn't come in until closer to the end.There were also some character development issues.  For instance, at the beginning, her dad comes across as a pot head whose car is a piece of junk.  Wait...he's the assistant principal?  That threw mw for a loop.  And Ryan is initially presented as a brooding teenager who doesn't so much as speak to Ashlyn. But on the first day of school, he's all smiley and talkative and BFFs with her.  How did that happen?Overall, I enjoyed the read, which I guess is the purpose.  I just don't know if I can overlook the above issues to say it was great.",3.0

8702,"As I read Blind Descent, the testimony of climber Brian Dickinson who survived alone and BLIND on Mount Everest, I was reminded of God&#8217;s unfailing love for his children.  Through this story, I learned a great deal about the science of climbing Mt. Everest.  During his journey to the summit, Dickinson became snow blind. This phenomenon occurs due to exposure to intense UV rays &#8212; basically a sunburn on the cornea. As awful as that sounds, how much worse is having it occur on top of Mt. Everest while you are ALONE? The thought makes my heart skip a beat. How many times have I felt spiritually snow blind? Unable to see beyond the reflection of the symbolic snow falling all around me, feeling alone and afraid? This is something that many people can understand, if not as a climbing experience but as a spiritual pain. From this book, I received a great deal of comfort knowing that God loves his children no matter where they are on Earth. I mean that both geographically and spiritually. There is nowhere you can go where God cannot be with you, from the highest point on Earth to the darkest part of your soul. No matter what is your Mt. Everest, God can help you overcome.

8704,"I think this book is very similar to the Fables graphic novel, which is basically like fairy tale characters living in modern day society, mingling with humans and acclimating to their new life. Obviously, the plot is a little different, but the gist is the same. I particularly love rewritten fairy tales, which is why I gave this 4 stars, but that may just be my own book genre bias. The reason I don't give it 5 is because the character development was PRETTY weak. Mina Grime and the cast of characters that come in later don't have very strong personas, which made some of her actions seem kind of random. Also, very big/weird events were described super fast and in vague-ish detail. I'm pretty imaginitive and I would read through the paragraphs describing secret passages, and I'd have to reread it again because I couldn't really draw up any kind of picture from her description. The story is still fun and there are little mini twists, which keep things interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the Grimm tales or the Fables comics.",4.0

8721,"Madeline Hunter is a truly wonderful writer. The prose flows beautifully and effortlessly, and I am a fan. Her characters are generally rich and complex, with much more seething under the surface than what is visible to the outside world. Her characters are rich in emotion and her writing is unique.Unfortunately, the plot and the characters in this novel are not all that interesting, I am sad to report. This is the last book in the series and it just fell a little flat.  Lydia the h has been introduced in prior books and we know that something is wrong with her. Her personality has changed and she has become almost addicted to gambling.  The rest of the time she is moping about. We find out here that Lydia thought she was in love with/had a crush on the man Penthurst the Duke H killed in a duel. This duel as we know from prior books seriously disrupted the close friendship of the 4 Hs in this series as the deceased, Baron Lakewood, was also a friend.  The series is about not only the romances of each of the 4 men, but also about resolution of their friendship.As many reviewers have commented, it is difficult to like or even feel much sympathy for Lydia on a number of levels. She comes across as moody, bratty, selfish and spoiled. She acts in very irrational and at times stupid ways.  Her obsession with Lakewood's death seems unbelievable given the small number of encounters we learn the two actually had. Penthurst is too narrowly drawn a character and we don't get that sense that much emotion exists or else he keeps it so tightly tamped down, we never really get to know who he is really is.  He is clearly honorable, responsible etc. But who is he at his core? We never really find that out. Several of the characters from the other books in the series reappear, but they seem somehow a shadow of the characters they were in their own books.My slight dissatisfaction with this book is that it is not really a romance.  This book is about wrapping up the loose ends from the other books, revealing what a cad Lakewood really was, and Lydia's slow realization that Lakewood had only pretended to care for her and that her moping aboput was all in vain. The premise about what can flow from a single event--the duel--and the repercussions it can have long after provides food for thought and I think the author does a fine job with that. However, all the other books had more of a plot than this premise and the stories seemed more believable for it. This novel seemed to drag on for  a long time, dwelling on boring details that were not that interesting, to be honest. I also did not like the resolution of the two ""villains"" and the hurried explanation at the end.My biggest complaint, however, is there seemed to be nothing other than physical attraction between the H and the h for most of the book. Neither really liked the other at the outset, nor did either even admire or respect the other. As the story progressed, we did not see much interaction between them on an emotional rather than physical level.  It was a little hard to believe at the end that they really did believe they loved each other. It seemed a little forced and artificial: ok, I have wrapped up my story and now these two need a HEA, so tell each other you love the other.  I left  with the impression I was pretty sure that whatever attraction they felt for the other would very soon evaporate. There was just not enough build-up of their relationship for me to believe it would last very long. There was a hint or two that perhaps they had actually been attracted to each other in the past, but for various reasons ignored that attraction and never admitted it to themselves. If the author had done even a little bit more with that, I would have been a lot happier.This is the first Madeline Hunter book that ever left me feeling a little disappointed. It is by no means a bad book; in fact, in many respects it is good. Just not up to the author's general standards and the rest of this series.",4.0

8732,"This book &#34;Easy to Build Birdhouses - A Natural Approach: Must Know Info to Attract and Keep the Birds You Want&#34; by A. J. Hamler a Popular Woodworking Paperback, is 143 pages of colorful pictures and bird house designs.  There is even a house designed like an old Box Camera, with viewer hole, winder and pushbutton.  This is one of my most visual Birdhouse Books, recently purchased to sate' my desire to buy everything out there on bird houses. Some of these houses laid out in the book are quite basic, like a nesting box for ducks mounted on a pole and then there are several designs that are almost like works of art, detailed, painted like a newly built home and with details that rival the doll houses made for a favorite little girl.  These are not necessarily in the line of a natural approach, but they are attractive and well built.  Each house is shown as completed in a full page color picture of it, where the author has it mounted for use and display.  Feeders are also shown in finished built pictures of full of feed for the birds to enjoy.  If you are a visual person and like to page through these types of books this book is for you.  If you want plans, complete with material lists, size descriptions and bird specific layouts, this book may fall short of what you are looking for and other books may please you more, I wanted more for detail, thus I will continue to look for more, ever more to purchase, usually used, to have for my collection of building books, not just birdhouses, but almost everything out there.

8747,"This is certainly the most unusual historical romance I've read, and I feel it fair to warn readers not to be taken in by the cliched and seemingly benign cover. It is in many aspects confusing, but nothing in the story can be compared to the pandemonium that occurred in the end, which frankly, frightened me a bit. Not that the resolution with the villain was unexpected, mind you, but the manner in which this was done -- and it revealed a hidden ruthlessness to the heroine that I was shocked to discover.As there was never a year given in the story, I'm tempted to judge by all the ""modernisms"" in this story and put it in the Victorian rather than the Regency (though given the author's previous works, it is probably set in the Regency period). The confusing aspects are a result of several factors, one of which being that the story begin very much in medias res. The heroine attempted to avoid being trapped into another bargain with the villain, who had been using her brother's gambling debts as a means of keeping her indebted to her, to eventually get her into his bed. Then, we jump to the hero's perspective as he had always wanted to court the heroine but had been waiting until he obtains a caption's position in order to do so. But as the story progresses, he is suddenly given a dukedom and the heroine is no longer someone of his social equal. To compound the problem, the hero, heroine, and villain all knew each other while growing up. And thus a triangular relationship is established by which the story progresses in increments of machinations, vast confusion - not to mention disturbances by (somewhat) insane and otherwise troublesome relatives, least of all a very abrupt ending that leaves me unconvinced of the protagonists' romance factor.By now you may wonder if this novel is truly as atrocious as I describe it so. No, it is not, but unfortunately I was too confused and astounded by the bloodthirstiness and rather insane behavior/plans of some of the characters to appreciate much of this story. In all seriousness, I would feel better were this labeled historical fiction with suspense elements rather than historical romance.My final verdict: I have briefly described my opinion of this book which can be interpreted as a mildly or overtly disfavorable opinion.*Review copy received via Netgalley",3.0

I did think some sections were slow and repetitive.",3.0
8751,As other reviewers have stated too much confusion in this novel.  Dueling Gorn battleships with confusing and similar character names makes this story a chore to follow at times.  Not a lot of action in this one.  The characters actions lacked depth and seemed very superficial written at times.  Disappointing in general.,2.0
8752,"This was a serious page turner, but each page has more horror on it than the last. Not for the faint of heart, but undeniably powerful because of it. My wife had to stop reading because she said it was too much, which I think is a compliment of the author's bravery and unflinching portrayal of Mirielle's captivity. An indictment of the violence men do.Only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me was some infelicities in the prose and that it could perhaps be 20-25 pages shorter/tighter. It's admirably unshowy, as it should be, but there's some lines that clang in the ear for lack of care and attention. Most of the book is so strong that those slight bobbles stand out all the more. Highly recommended for the right kind of reader.",4.0
8753,"I have been an avid Death series reader for ten or so years.  The first bunch of books in this series were amazing.  I couldn't wait until the next book was released.  It's not like that anymore.  I occasionally buy a book from the series, this was that occasion.  It's the same old story line with the same old predictable plot.  I bought this book in December of 2013 and just finished it (April 2014).  I became bored reading it so I stopped.  It doesn't grab you and hold you  until you finish reading it.  The last book I enjoyed was NY to Dallas, the few before that were so so, the ones after that are also so so.  I truly hope that Nora Roberts (JD Robb) steps up to the plate and gives this series a story line it deserves.  I know she's capable of it, but I think that she's publishing books so quickly and using ghost writers that this series is lacking in quality.

8762,"Quilters are artists.  I truly believe this.  Fabric sewn together, is not much different than paint on a canvas.  When I take on a project, I feel like I'm recreating an artist's designs similar to painting-by-number.  Each artist has their favorite medium and Cheryl Almgren Taylor's is clearly applique.  She has poured her heart into the eleven spectacular projects of this book as a presentation of faith, hope, and love, from a Christian perspective.  Using batik fabrics as paint and her sewing machine as brush; Cheryl paints a portrait of God's promises from the Bible.  Her imagery is inspirational.  I am confident that anyone who shares this belief would love and treasure these offerings.  I'm so happy that I purchased this book.  The photographs shown in the Look Inside feature sold me this book, however it's even better in person.Using the symbolism of the Bible, which Taylor explains in the introduction, she chose three passages from the Old Testament and eight from the New Testament.From Genesis 2:9, ""The Tree of Life"" is characterized on a pillow cover; Joshua 24:15, a much beloved verse, comes to life in the wall hanging, ""As For Me and My House;"" and another wall hanging, ""We Are His Sheep,"" illuminates God's viewpoint that He is the Shepherd and we, His people, are the sheep in His pasture, from Psalm 100.The designs representing the New Testament:  ""Fishers of Men,"" reflects Jesus' promise in Matthew 4:19; ""Daily Bread"" a familiar concept from The Lord's Prayer, (Matthew 6:11) is featured in two projects; our value to God, (Matthew 6:26) is portrayed in  ""Birds of the Air;"" God's reminder that we should not worry, (Luke 12:27-28) is depicted in ""Lilies of the Field;"" The Bible's instruction of remaining in Christ so we would bear fruit, (John 15:5) is shown in ""I Am the Vine;"" (Galatians 5:22-23) is displayed in ""Fruits of the Spirit;"" and finally, ""Faith, Hope, and Love"" beautifully illustrates 1 Corinthians 13:13.To accomplish her ""paintings,"" Cheryl chooses fusible web applique.  There are comprehensive instructions for using fusible web.  The templates are full-sized.  At the back of the book is ""Quilt Making Basics,"" which covers Taylor's recommendations on fabrics, tools & supplies, rotary cutting, adding borders, and binding.  There isn't instruction given for quilting, but we can see the quilting in the lovely photographs of the finished products.I also liked,Deck the Halls: Quilts to Celebrate Christmasby Cheryl Almgren Taylor.",5.0

Everything you've ever wanted to know about climate change is presented here in clear and concise language with all of the graphs that help us wrap our heads around the situation.

From there, Timbuktu is a four day trip by bus and boat on and along the Niger River, all the time traveling eastward and deeper into what we used to call ""the Heart of Darkest Africa!""  Even a seasoned traveler would think twice and the author is a middle-aged guy who has scarcely ever been outside of his native Scotland. All he knew about Timbuktu is that his mother used to threaten to send him there when he misbehaved.For reasons which he's still unable to explain, he jokingly told his wife that she could buy him a ticket there for his 60th birthday  and she took him at his word.  The die was cast, even though he first had to go to Dakar, Senegal to get a visa.  He traveled to Timbuktu on the buses and boats used by the locals.  When he arrived he found a town which was much reduced from it's glory days as the center of the north African caravan routes.  The desert has taken over parts of the town and there is the looming presence of camps of Tuaregs - Islamic Bedouins  who controlled the area before the French took over in the 19th century.  Ironically, Tuareg rebels captured the town in April 2012 and held it for almost a year before it was re-taken by French and Malian forces. Today the area is not considered safe for travel.The writing is sometimes rough, but the author is likable and honest and it's just a great story!",5.0

8780,Good God where to start with this review..... I mean HOLY HELL I started reading this book and my heart went out to all three of the alpha males in this story.On a very snowy day Kieth and Reed are sitting at home spending time together when they spot something out of the ordinary. When they go to look to see what it is they spot a guy. Not sure who he is Kieth is suspicious of him but something in Reed is saying there is something wrong with the guy for him to be out in the middle of a snow storm.Reed decides he and Kieth need to nurse him back to health but Kieth is reluctant until Reed tells him it is okay to open up and trust him. Shane wakes up and realizes he is in a different place and he is not sure who he is and why he there but he does know he is in danger and he has to put the pieces together in order to find out what is going on with him.As Shane tries to uncover his life he and Reed and Kieth begin to develop a friendship and Reed has even started to have feelings for him. But Kieth is weary of him and wants to keep his distance. That is easier said then done because when Shane is in danger the guys come to his rescue and realize that they need to protect him and put their differences aside.Will Kieth put his feelings out there and give in to the feelings he has for Shane or will he turn his back on him and let him figure things out on his own?,5.0

8782,"I am not the Mother of a child with cancer. But I have made friends with a lot of mothers of children who have fought/are fighting cancer. One day, a friend shared a story of her friend's daughter who had cancer. I chose not to look away, as too many do. What I watched over the next 4 years was heartwrenching and terrifying for any mother to even think of, let alone experience. I became determined to find a way to help, and got involved with many cancer families, and I have watched so many families struggle to cope with the death of their beautiful children..I've seen parents living in fear of the day they are told the monster is back..I've seen children nearly die from the side effects of their cancer treatments, and I've seen children DIE from the side effects. I know that the heartache I felt for them was not even a pinch of the pain they felt and feel today. I have worked for years with special needs adults and children..and while it is a hard road it is not an impossible one. Impossible is when you are told there is nothing left that can be done, impossible is watching your child die a slow, agonizing death. Cancer is nothing to say you wish your child had whether you mean it in a different way or not. This author should have thought twice about the families who have really been through cancer and are going through it. It's offensive and this is the worst title I've seen for a book.. Maybe your life is hard, but so many others have it harder. And you didn't need such an offensive title. Autism will not ravage your child's body the way Cancer does, and it certainly won't take their life.To mothers with children who have fought or are fighting cancer, I am so sorry this book exists.. To mother's who have lost their child, I am sorry for your loss.This book should simply be removed..",1.0

8785,"If you&#8217;ve landed on this page, you probably already know that Tony Hillerman was a mystery writer best known for his stories in and around the Navajo Indian Reservation. The central figure, Joe Leaphorn, works for the Navajo Tribal Police &#8211; though he has decided to retire at the start of this book. Leaphorn&#8217;s investigation intersects with that of Jim Chee, who has his own concerns and a different, more traditional approach to the Navajo culture than does Leaphorn.Like Hillerman&#8217;s other books, this one has a strong sense of place. Beat-up dirt roads, back-of-nowhere places lying down forgotten tracks, a desert landscape and possibility of rain all mark the book.Hillerman&#8217;s series also relies on clashes of culture &#8211; most obviously that between whites and Navajos, but also differences in worldview between Leaphorn and Chee. Status differences in the white world also play an important role in how characters behave. Some characters understand one another and respect cultural differences; others don&#8217;t. Sadly, many of the people who don&#8217;t respect others are anthropologists and archaeologists.  As in many of Hillerman&#8217;s mysteries, you can see some reasons here why Native Americans tend to dislike these professions.The story moves well, but the mystery was unsatisfying &#8211; I didn&#8217;t find the culprit well-drawn or the crime well-motivated. However, the real point of the book is the journey across a landscape, not a clever mystery puzzle.",3.0

8788,"Friendship essentially involves a distinctive kind of concern for your friend, a concern which might reasonably be understood as a kind of love. Set in the late &#8216;80s Glowing Embers revolves around the lives of two girls; Pashen and Valentina.  For most, starting your freshman year in high school is a joyous occasion but for Pashen and Valentina it marks the turmoil both of their lives encounter.Pashen was an only child, she was the apple of her mother&#8217;s eye and likewise she loved her mother with all her being.  Alma however was lonely and begins to relate with Bill.  After marrying Bill, Pashen&#8217;s life changes.  Bill is unlike Alma and Pashen, he is unlearned and abusive.  His growing disdain for Pashen and intellect reflects in his treatment of Alma.  Pashen endures the months to years of turmoil stemming from neglect and seeing her mother belittled and abused; mentally and physically.Valentina is the youngest daughter born to her family.  She is the delight of her parents.  However her life takes a turn for the worst, when her mother decides the life she wants is not the one she is living.  Valentina is an old soul, even in the midst of chaos she is the strength that propels her family forward.Through the bonds of friendship and sisterhood, Pashen and Valentina triumph against the elements of hatred, jealousy and the many obstacles life threw at them.  Their unity survived the fire.  Glowing Embers in a Dying Fire is a nostalgic tale of friendship and strength.  At the end of the day, it reminds us of the most precious thing in life.  LOVE.",5.0

Typically, I don&#8217;t pick up something this short (even if it&#8217;s free), but I was in the mood for a time-travel romance.  My rating takes the length into account, for I would drop a star (plus) if the same weaknesses kept going for a full-length novel.But first the strengths: I thought the author did a great job with Rose's confusion and struggle/inability to cope with life in the 13th century. I know I certainly couldn&#8217;t sew a decent hem to save my life. It was good to see the imperfections and not an I-can-do-anything heroine. Also, the external goals/plot was clearly explained (Rose's need to get back to her time and Julien's need to &#8220;graduate&#8221; from under this mentor in order to strike out on his own). How that was going to be accomplished moved the quick story forward.However, I missed some items from the story that I wish would have been included. No steps towards love. Just some mild lusting-my-you&#8217;re-attractive for most of the story and then to undying love with no real reason &#8211; no external circumstance or internal decision. What this really comes down to is &#8220;the why&#8221; or their motivation.  How does the one fulfill an internal need for the other that no one else has done in the past? It was very muddled. I realize it is hard to accomplish that task in a novella to a satisfying depth, but I missed it nonetheless.That said, I would recommend the story if you are looking for a quick poolside read or the like, and I would consider other stories by the author.  As a matter of full disclosure, I received my Kindle version free from Story Cartel [dot] com in exchange for a balanced and honest review.",4.0

8795,"This talented author&#8217;s love of Alaska shines through as she tells the world of its past.In this, the first book in the series, the author takes her readers right back in time, to when the first Alaska Natives arrived, there after crossing the Bering Sea Land Bridge,  thousands of years ago, and through history until the famous Klondike Gold Rush in the nineteenth century.She does this wonderfully, bringing the history of this amazing place to life, through short stories, which vary tremendously. Through her brilliant penmanship, she brings alive the lives of these people who made this made this land their own under incredibly harsh conditions.For me, though, I have to say the wonderful collection of hundreds of pictures were the icing on this most enjoyable cake. Being able to actually SEE the people who were alive in those times past is a joy I will never tire of, and it enhanced even more (if possible) my enjoyment of these wonderful tales.I have never been to Alaska, however I would love to do so, especially having read this book.",5.0

8804,"As in the other books, we meet some new characters this time and get to know others a lot better.  This book focuses on Genevieve, a brilliant and slightly nerdy MIT student, and Chad, a somewhat broken vampire.  Genevieve really blossoms in this story, but even her growth doesn't make her lose the most endearing part of her... her social awkwardness that makes her so cute.  I like that Chad wasn't created to be vampire perfection.  Instead, he had doubts and he was, at least in his own eyes, broken.  It was a great twist to the standard YA romantic hero.Fans of  Maggie and Shane are going to be disappointed because there is little of them in this book.  But the story is growing and it is obvious that they will be back.  I like this way of building the story, getting different perspectives in different books by focusing on different characters.  There is a lot of action and a whole lot of mystery and intrigue building and building.  I can't wait to see where it goes next!Things to love...--Genevieve.  I like that she finds her own strengths and starts to appreciate herself.--Anticipation.  The story is building to a climax, adding layers with each book!Things I wanted more/less of...--Chloe, Maggie, and Shane.  These three are fan favorites and even though they aren't the center of the story right now, I wish there had been a little more of them.Some Quotastic Goodness--My chest is so tight, it hurts.  I pant, trying to keep quiet when I want to gasp.  I wish I had a paper bag, but my captors have taken everything from me- most importantly, my freedom (Loc. 37).--And holding her against me as we hung off the side of that train... I felt something (Loc. 751).--It's a ton of pressure on her, putting the lives of so many humans, and our group in particular, on Genevieve.  But she hasn't complained once.  She's a fighter, she just fights with a unique set of tools, the best of  which is her exquisite mind (Loc. 1793).My Recommendation:  This is a great series.  Vamps and mystery and romance... what more could you want?!  Next up is Delicate Accord, due out in the summer of 2014.  This will be Lily and Caleb's story.This review originally appeared on my blog, [...]",4.0
8805,"If you haven't already read the previous books of this series, you might want to since these stories are forever entwining. I love how this author can take a character who sees themself as insignificant, and definately NOT what they were destined to be, and turn them into something from legend where everyone knows without a doubt who they are. Every detail can be significant. In this story, Lionheart's cousin, Foxbrush, is at a place where he is about to assume the throne of the Eldest and marry the lady he's always loved. Problem is, Foxbrush is so far from being ready it's unreal. He struggles with seeing himself as someone who could be respected. He's terrified of crowds and prefers books to people. When his bride-to-be, Daylily,runs off before the wedding, he decides to step out of his comfort zone and go after her, if only to tell her he loves her enough to let her go if that's really what she wants. Meanwhile Daylily is on a mission to finally be free of obligations and once and for all destroy all the fierceness of her true self. These two must become all they were meant to be, before it's too late and what they know of their past and future becomes destroyed. Don't worry, this story still has all the fairies, knights of farthest shore, and power hungry nobles we know and love:) Altogether a mix that captures you from start to finish! Happy reading:)",5.0

It's not in your face, it's not a secret that is finally dumped on you, it's a slow unraveling, with enough clues to make you piece things together.And once you put two and two together, your still surprised by an added revelation.  Wonderful writing, wonderful execution.The characters were well-developed, and the interactions were tight and pithy.  The friends were supportive without being necessarily smarter than the protagonists, and the families could actually exist.  Avery's parents didn't feel like caricatures as can some times happen when portraying those type of personalities.Terrific job keeping me involved in the story and taking me on Cam and Avery's journey.

I had to know what happened, I really enjoyed and hated Dominic's and Bronagh's banter. I just couldn't wait to read about their journey and hoping they could let each other In.Bronagh is a strong willed woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind and use her words and or hands when needed.Dominic is an intense, Dominating, loving, beast. He has a temper and is ruthless.Branna is Bronagh's sister who took over as guardian when Their parents died. Family is first and she just wants to see her sister happy.I really enjoyed the story of Dominic and Bree and fell in love with their characters and felt a strong connection to them.At times I was shocked and like WTH when Dominic and Bree were having their fits. I couldn't believe what he would say and call her. Their banter back and forth at times were funny and at times emotional.I felt such an emotional connection with Bree, when she was hurt and felt alone I was getting teary eyed and felt for her. Then I was happy when she finally gave Dom another chance and they both let their guard down a little and let each other in.L.A brings us on an emotional roller coaster and on Bree's journey from shutting people out after her parents died to letting love in. Dominic's journey is always having to be strong and helping his family out and to deciding to put himself and his feelings first when he can't get a certain someone out of his mind.&#34;You've always been mine, pretty girl.

8827,"I can't wait for Book 2! Plague of Angels puts a new spin (I surely hope) on the story of Jesus and gods of religion/mythology. It tells the plan of the Descended Nyx and her followers, Ishtar and Persephone, to rule hell, regain heaven and ultimately paradise (all at Tribunal's/Jesus' bidding). This part of the saga accounts for the 1000 years after the crucifixion of Jesus/Tribunal and his plan to overthrow God, with Nyx at his side. But even to a god (or goddess), a lot can happen in a thousand years. Even the best laid plans will or will not bear fruit.I really liked the book, but some may not care for the graphic nature. Just because you see God and Angels, Heaven and Hell does not imply a Sunday School lesson. The Holy Bible it is not. It is a pretty fast and easy read with quite a bit of action to it.

I was taken on an emotional journey of life, loss, hurt and beautiful redemption. A Blue Tale has a totally different vibe than her debut duet, Haven from the Storm (Storms of Life #1) and Before the Storm (Storms of Life Series) , but it is equally addictive!Sarah has a way of making you feel pain where you really didn't think was possible. Taking a risk with this book, Sarah stepped away from everything that was comfortable and wrote a beautifully tragic love story. She broke me down, only to build me back up with an amazing ending.A musician with a dark and twisty past, a beautiful woman who's grown up in the shadows of her father's rock star life...when their lives collide for a second time, there's no turning back for either one.

Inferno continues Dan Brown's portrayal of Professor Robert Langdon who uses his unique skills in code breaking and knowledge of history and art, to solve current problems involving the Catholic Church.Now, I may be off when I say his writings all deal with the Catholic Church. I should say, the three Robert Langdon books I have read were rooted in Catholicism, the Vatican, etc. In this book, Brown does a great job of weaving Dante's Inferno into modern times. Without giving away the plot, Langdon gets involved in a plot to &#34;bring Dante's vision of hell to Earth&#34;.The writing is great, the plot is well put together. However, the premise for the plot is contrived and a bit of a stretch.

This gets easier as the book moves along because the names and locations become more familiar, but to truly understand the first half of the book, one must read it again with the accumulated knowledge of having read the entire book. Other than that, it was written so that the non-military mind can understand the various situations with limited knowledge of tactical jargon and that's a good thing for those of us who do not have a military background but enjoy reading books about the history of our military to get a better appreciation at what they do to provide security for Americans and allies alike.",4.0

8862,"It's not secret that I'm a huge fan Chef Mark Reinfeld's The 30 Minute Vegan series of books. (Just read my earlier reviews.) Every edition is a winner, featuring recipes that are so layered in complexity of flavors, it's hard to believe they can be prepared in under an hour, let alone, thirty minutes. Soup's On is jam-packed with more than 100 quick and easy recipes that will delight every palate. And we're not talking appetizer soups here. We're talking show-stopping dishes that are so nourishing, filling, and satisfying, you'll never think of soup as merely the prelude to an entr&eacute;e again.Along with a scrumptious variety of soups and stews, you'll find lots of delicious extras&#8212;from Herbed Bread Sticks to Red Pepper Coulis, Soup's On elevates the art of vegan soup-making to new culinary heights. While every soup and stew within the pages of this book stands on its own, each recipe comes with suggested variations, as well as the perfect accompaniments, so you won't have to guess how to put together an absolutely fabulous meal. Just a few of the recipes I have already made from Soup's on include Mark's sweet and spicy Brazilian Black Bean Soup with Baked Plantain. Black beans make this sumptuous Latin treat nutritious and hearty. Maple-baked plantain and a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice add a touch of sweetness, and jalape&ntilde;o and chipotle pepper add a zesty bite. Raw Cashew Cr&egrave;me frache counterbalances the heat, and Candied Pepitas add another lovely touch of sweetness and a bit of crunch.Mark's Asian-inspired Hot Pot with Soba Noodles, Seared Shiitake Mushrooms and Baby Bok Choy is a heavenly choice on a cold, wet, winter day. Broken down into three simple-to-prepare recipes for Baked Tofu, Seared Shiitake and Baby Bok Choy, and a savory noodle-and-vegetable-infused broth, you'll love how this dish comes together so easily. With clear and concise instructions, it's a breeze to flow from one step to the next, tackling more than one task at a time. While the noodles and broth are cooking, it's time to prepare the shiitake and bok choy.If you love the sweet, smoky flavor of BBQ, then the recipe for down-home BBQ Tempeh and Roasted Corn Stew will satisfy your taste buds. I served it with Cosmic Double Corn Bread and topped it with toasted pepitas, but it would have been a complete meal all on its own. Mark's soul-satisfying Roasted Root Vegetable Soup is loaded with onions, carrots, fennel, parsnips, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes (I used yams). It's seasoned to perfection with just the right blend of herbs and balsamic.

Every edition (The 30 Minute Vegan, The 30 Minute Vegan's Taste of the East, and The 30 Minute Vegan's Taste of Europe) is a winner, featuring recipes that are so layered in complexity of flavors, it's hard to believe they can be prepared in under an hour, let alone, thirty minutes. The latest installment is called Soup's On, and it's filled with more than 100 quick and easy recipes that will delight every palate. And we're not talking appetizer soups here. We're talking show-stopping dishes that are so nourishing, filling, and satisfying, you'll never think of soup as just the prelude to an entr&eacute;e again.Along with a scrumptious variety of soups and stews, you'll find lots of delicious extras&#8212;from Herbed Bread Sticks to Red Pepper Coulis, Soup's On elevates the art of soup making to new culinary heights.

Maple-baked plantain and a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice add a touch of sweetness, and jalape&ntilde;o and chipotle pepper add a zesty bite.

With clear and concise instructions, it's a breeze to flow from one step to the next, tackling more than one task at a time. While the noodles and broth are cooking, it's time to prepare the shiitake and bok choy. What a beautiful presentation, don't you think?If you love the sweet, smoky flavor of BBQ, then this delectable down-home BBQ Tempeh and Roasted Corn Stew is right up your alley. I served it with Cosmic Double Corn Bread and topped it with toasted pepitas. Until toasting pepitas (aka pumpkin seeds), I hadn't realized I enjoyed them so much. Pumpkin seeds are a great source of vitamin E, protein, iron, magnesium, and zinc. And toasting them for less than 20 minutes ensures that they're cooked under the threshold for unwanted changes to the seeds' healthy fats.With another wave of Arctic cold air whipping through this week and anticipated temperatures dipping down into the teens, I will surely be making this soul-satisfying Roasted Root Vegetable Soup again. Loaded with onions, carrots, fennel, parsnips, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes (I used yams), it's seasoned to perfection with just the right blend of herbs and balsamic. Topped with Tofu Feta, it's a Mediterranean feast in a bowl!I could go on and on about all of the recipes I've made from Soup's On so far, each one a delightful surprise, more delicious than the last. The 30 Minute Vegan Soup's On will have you turning out tasty, filling, and hearty bowls of goodness in less time than it takes to order takeout. And your meals will be so much more delicious, nutritious, and satisfying than anything you'll find on a takeout menu. While we're still in the midst of winter's cold embrace, get your hands on a copy of this wonderful book. The recipe for Seared Shiitake and Baby Bok Choy alone, is worth the modest cover price. And if you enjoy slurping soup in the warmer months, you'll be covered, because there are lots of spring and summer soup recipes in Soup's On, too!",5.0
8863,"There is so much emphasis on the heroine's plainness, that it is hard to imagine a handsome man falling in love with her. Still, her loving ways and willingness to do what is needed no matter how lowly, makes her a lovely woman. It is easy to understand why Miss Ellie would marry Jackson on such short notice considering her horrible circumstances. It is all so easy to understand why Jackson would choose a loveless marriage with a plain woman based on his past love and his dead wife. His boys need a mother. He needs....well, he doesn't know what he needs because of the anger in his heart. Slowly her love for his boys and her quiet spiritual strength and her handling of difficult situations brings Jackson to the realization that he has found what real love is.",5.0
8864,"The third book in the Rogue Hunter series really throws us for some loops. I was caught a little off guard with how much of the story was focused on her sex life. I would go so far as to saying it's a little risque crossing into the erotica zone in several scenes. A little more descriptive scenes than I would normally read.This series amazing, the world building and characters are so well done that I just cannot get enough of this series. Zyra has a lot of ups and downs in this story. She gets sick and falls in love. Along with this whirlwind romance comes a lot of vulnerability from Zyra. I even felt that we lose a bit of the Zyra we have grown to know and see her having to crawl her way out of an emotional hole that has taken a toll on her.Zyra still shows her bad ass side with not only being sick, in a roller coaster relationship, but also being hunted by hired killers. Several plot twists and harsh situations that come along with both. She still manages to find her way through things with a lot of action, and heartbreak.The writing is spot on when it comes to getting the readers emotionally invested in the story. There were times I was so upset that I had to stop reading for awhile and I really felt for the relationships, both good and bad that occur in this book.I recommend this series 100% as a very well written, plotted, and high paced space opera. It's a series that I have added to my automatic to-buy list because I know each new edition will be an amazing, entertaining and enjoyable read.",4.0
8865,This book was an easy read that grabbed you right from the beginning.  I felt like a fly on the wall throughout the book.  The author has a way of making you feel like you are a part of the story; a witness to what's going on.  The characters were lively and interesting.  Got this book kind of as a just because and I'm so glad I did!!,4.0

Sparky was so passionate in a hidden underlying way in Bike Bait that I couldn't wait to read more about him.This story literally enticed me, trapped me, and kept me wanting more that I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting. There were times I wanted to slap both Sparky and Bonnie but their love for each other was so fierce I couldn't help but feel like if they didn't pull through what is there to look forward to in real life? Pathetic I know ; that's what I get for Being a book junkie.",5.0
8869,"The thing about Mind Games is that I was terribly detached to all the characters right from the start. If I made any connection with any of the characters, it would have to be James. He actually had a compelling &#34;backstory,&#34; and he actually had normal, human feelings, unlike Fia and Annie. For one, Fia really doesn't have a personality. Or if she does, it just describes her as one word&#8212;crazy. She's legitimately crazy. And her sister Annie isn't much better. Annie might not be crazy, but I'm certainly not crazy about her.Right off the bat this book caught my attention, but within 20 pages, it lost it. I thought Adam was going to be an interesting character to read about, but he wasn't present for the majority of the novel. The idea of Fia being trained from a young age to assassinate people and then choose not to assassinate a geeky teenage boy over a dog is ludicrous. (Fia sees Adam petting a dog on the side of the street, and she decides to not kill him. Like what?)Enough about the characters. The world-building/writing is a whole other matter. For one, as a reader you're thrown into the plot unexpectedly. At first, that worked toward the book's advantage, instantly showing the reader action. But as the book went along, the lack of world-building really irritated me. I never really knew what was going on. I picked up on certain aspects of the novel, but it took the entire 237 pages to figure out the majority of the plot. And it took me a good 30-50 pages to figure out that Annie was blind.Also, the writing was enough to get me to groan. Fia did things three times. Three. Freaking. Times. She tap, tap, tapped and pop, pop, popped. Yeah, well, she drove, drove, drove me insane. OH, YES. And Annie had NO REGARD for her sister whatsoever. Annie was always talking/thinking about how she loved her sister, but she didn't really show it. In my mind, Annie was holding Fia back unknowingly.I really don't know what to say about this book, because there really isn't much to say. After 50%, the plot got really slow and somewhat meaningless. I felt like it was a gigantic prologue, especially with the constant flashbacks. I would've been semi-okay with the flashbacks if they actually moved the plot along, but the thing is, the flashbacks did nothing for the novel, which once again lowered my rating for the book.Despite my two star rating, I didn't dislike this book, but I didn't like it either. I don't really have any strong feelings toward it (okay, maybe strong feelings toward snapping Fia's fingers off if she tap, tap, taps them one more time, but that's beside the point); I'm pretty neutral about the whole book. I won an ARC for Perfect Lies, so I'll be reading the next book, but it's not high on my TBR. I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you're looking for a quick read and don't mind not feeling anything for the characters/plot/world-building.",2.0

8872,"Hello &#8211; Robin from Hesperia Loves Books, here. Last night, I finished reading what may be one of my favorite novels, ever &#8211; Maybe Someday by Colleen Hoover. This novel has been on my radar for months. I had spoken with friends who were fortunate enough to read advanced reader copies at the beginning of February, so I knew this story was going to be special. It was unprecedented. Colleen Hoover&#8217;s best work yet. The music awesome. The story is powerful.Ridge Lawson is a musician with writer&#8217;s block. Sydney Blake lives in apartment located across the courtyard of his apartment complex. She listens to Ridge play guitar in the evenings and has no trouble coming up with her own lyrics to his music. Ridge realizes this, so he asks Sydney to assist him with writing several new songs for his band. The story is told from an alternating first-person point of view.Maybe Someday is not just a novel &#8211; it is an experience. This project is a collaboration between American Idol star, Griffin Peterson, and novelist, Colleen Hoover. Griffin wrote an original soundtrack for the novel, and the lyrics of his songs are used in the novel. Readers will find a link to each of the songs of the soundtrack in the novel and will be able to listen to the songs being performed while reading the lyrics.Slow-build romances are truly my weakness. Colleen Hoover wrote the perfect novel for me. Have you ever read a novel where the characters make love to each other without truly making love? Ridge and Sydney do this. They share so much respect, tenderness and affection for each other. Thank you for your beautiful words, Colleen. I am completely over the moon. Maybe Someday is one story I will never forget.",5.0
8873,"I think I fallen in love with this author. This IS my first book by Phillip Tomasso and I was totally impressed. Let me begin to say, these are some creepy zombies which will appeal to zombie lovers. The characters are where it's at in this book and I was taken-in by the 'ordinariness' of an everyday situation and how it turned into a nightmare. This is one of those good books, you start and just can't stop. Every page, every chapter held it together for this reader. I'm going to start on the next book and I know I won't be disappointed.",5.0
8874,"Great story /plot and overall writing. Just a bit light on salty extreme detail of rigging, etc. but only sailors would notice, others get enough for a nautical atmosphere. I would have liked to have seen a few line drawings of ships types mentioned, such sloop, cutter, brig and snow in a center or appendix section. Also a good map of the islands, southern Italy, Greece and Turkey to better follow the action. As one who has spent years in the area, knowing Greek and fair Turkish, the plot twists involving these regions and people were an added attraction and give an insight to a little known theater of the Napoleanic Wars. A very enjoyable book with (thankfully) a PG rating unlike another otherwise excellent nautical series. Highly recommend reading it, and ask author to add maps in the next edition. A yar read!",4.0
8875,"Widowed with 2 sons to care for, Lena has taken on the heavy work of farming in the late 1800's. For three years she has managed to do a &#34;man's&#34; work as well as her motherly duties. She's received marriage proposals from local farmers, but while they might be able to relieve her of the farm work, they are not the men of character she wants for her husband and the father of her boys. It occurs to her that widowed men in her position often advertise back east for a wife, and she decides to try the same seeking a husband. The man is chosen from those who responded and she waits in eager anticipation for him to arrive. But Gabriel is not at all the man she expected him to be; he,s fat, clumsy, socially awkward, totally  inexperienced at farming, and, due to the fact that he prefers to read rather than be around people, he uses a lot of big words that make him difficult to understand. It's not love at first for Gabriel, either. He had expected that a woman who had to advertise for a husband must be pretty plain to look at, but Lena is attractive. Gabriel has had nothing but hurt and rejection from attractive women, including his mother. He believes no attractive woman would remain faithful for long and that she would belittle him. He had wanted a stable home like he had never known before and now it seems that dream was in jeopardy. But both of them wanted God's will to be done in their lives and had committed to this union feeling it was what He was providing. Can it work? Is there any hope for the loving home they both want? This is a very nicely written book, and DiAnn Mills deserves credit for writing something unique in modern romances--the introduction of a male love interest with less than the normally required 6-pack abs. A truly heartwarming story.",5.0

8887,I found this book difficult to put down and an interesting history. However readers should know that it is much more about growing up gay and dying of AIDS than it is about a search for a child given up for adoption.

His books may be set in different time periods with very different characters, but the plots and the characterization are always well developed.  This book in particular is very prescient.  It is almost like scanning today's newspaper headlines.  I certainly don't want to offer any spoilers, but suffice it to say that the main character, Buddy Korda, is definitely a reluctant prophet.

8902,"Let me preface this review by saying I have read and enjoyed every book Grisham has written. Generally he is quite entertaining and the reader usually doesn't know what's coming at the end. Sadly, this book isn't up to the same quality of his other legal fiction.He starts with the suicide of a wealthy man who has just  written (as in ink on paper) a new will. The term holographic will should not be strange to any Grisham fan, as his earlier book, The Testament, begins the same way.I will try not to give away anything we learn at the end, although I will say i figured it out very early in this slow reading book. We do learn early on that there is an earlier will, prepared by some hotshot lawyers at a big out of town law firm. It leaves his assets to his kids and grandkids and uses the full extent of legal mumbo jumbo, tax planning and other legerdemain  to minimize the estate taxes due upon one's death. All well and good--the guy was smart, made a lot of money, and didn't want the taxman to get his mitts into his pile of cash. I liked the guy.So, if you have slogged through this book to the end, I'll ask you some simple questions:1. If you wanted to take care of someone, would you wait YEARS until you are literally dead before you did ANYTHING to help that person? There are a lot of ways to transfer assets/cash, with minimal tax consequences.2. If you wanted to leave someone your estate after death, why would you create a freakin' prior will and then hire Jake Brigance to fight the other beneficiaries because you never revoked that earlier will while alive? It would be INSANE to do this. If you hated your family, and Seth makes it clear he did, why ever sit down and create such a document? Even if you changed your mind after creating the first will, send the big shot law firm a notarized (or whatever) letter that simply says I revoke my will of such and such a date, signed Seth Hubbard. Have a nice day! Or go to their office in the flesh, whatever--it is your money and the lawyers are simply carrying out your wishes. You have the right to change your mind. Ask for the original out of their vault (yes there is a will vault) and tear it up with witnesses present. The ultimate revocation!3. Then, have that same hotshot law firm, using the same tax minimizing tricks, create a new will that leaves the money to your beneficiary of choice, again minimizing what the taxman collects, using generation skipping trusts, etc.. This is what a smart businessman like Seth Hubbard would have done.4. Even if you developed memory problems and had forgotten the address of the bigshot law firm, if you knew you were going to kill yourself and that there was definitely going to be a contest over the prior will (see above), why not go to a real lawyer, revoke the prior will and make another one? On the first few pages, we learn that Seth hated lawyers but liked Jake (by reputation). So get down to the Square in Clanton, have Jake make you a new will, which revokes the earlier one and creates new beneficiaries, and THEN go kill yourself.Finally, there are mysteries here, as to the WHY. Without revealing the who, what, when,... we do find out the answers toward the end. Seth does literally nothing to explain things to anyone before he dies, nor does he leave behind any documents that would explain why he did what he did. This is the same guy who buys a grave plot, arranges things with the undertaker, plans who will sing which hymn at his service and names his pallbearers. But he doesn't give any reason for why he leaves his fortune to his housekeeper. It remains for a third party to provide the explanation. Seth has a very valid reason--why on earth would he take that to the grave, knowing that it may remain a mystery for all time? For a guy we keep hearing about was really sharp and knew what he was doing, I really have my doubts.",1.0
8903,"This was my first read by this author but it will definitely NOT be my last. The book got off to a really &#34;busy&#34; start. There were lots of characters and then the author did an excellent job of alternating back and forth between the character's real names and their chat line handles. This further added to my confusion.Toward the middle of the book, the plot thickened so much that I got used to the characters and even when I wasn't 100% sure who was with who half the time, the story got so good that it didn't matter. I actually would have enjoyed seeing this story as a movie. The authors painted such clear images in my mind that I felt as if I was watching it as opposed to reading.As I read the book, I wondered how would HOOD bring everything together. Well, he did NOT disappoint me. I hate to read spoilers in reviews so I won't give anything away. I will say that this is an excellent read and I can appreciate the thought and attention to details the writer put into the book. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because there were so many characters and so many names and I had to keep double-checking myself and that slowed me down a bit. This book was entertaining, original and kept me on edge.I'll be reading the next book in the Black Love series soon.",4.0

I had read a lot about the Civil War before this but never about the prisons and this book was very detailed and much of the detail came from actual diaries left by men who had been at the prison.  The inhumane conditions at Andersonville prison in  Georgia caused the deaths of over 13,000 Union soldiers in a little over a year.  The people in the nearby town knew what was going on and this is the story of what some of them tried to do to make things better.  To me it was more than a book about the Civil War but it was a book about all wars and the way that we treat other people during war.  I think it is a book that should be read by everyone.",5.0

I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of the same.",5.0
8917,"Before I get into the details about why I LOVED this book and the trilogy as a whole, I need to put out a disclaimer: Under The Never Sky is a character heavy trilogy. It relies solely on the personalities, developments and actions of its characters. Just like many dystopias out there, it sets up a world for you but it does NOT extend beyond that. Do we know how the aethers came to be? No. Do we know how and why the PODS were set up? No. Why were the people separated to begin with? None of that becomes a focus. If you are looking for extensive world building and answers in regards to this dark, deadly, electrical storm ravaged world &#8211; this book is NOT for you.If you are looking for an array of interesting characters, leads worthy of rooting for, romance that never, ever, ever overshadows the plot, strong friendships, disturbing villains and a constant sense of danger, this trilogy IS most definitely for you.With all that said, Into the Still Blue left me completely satisfied. Coming from me, it&#8217;s a great compliment. To be fair, it wasn&#8217;t the most exciting book (Through The Ever Night remains the strongest in the bunch) but it did what it was supposed to do &#8211; conclude the story in the way that made sense to the text. Rossi never loses focus. Her writing is smooth, clear and descriptive enough. No purple prose here.  In the current, oversaturated market of trilogies, too many authors attempt to stray in order to be &#8220;edgy&#8221; (looking at you Veronica Roth and that pile of garbage you call books.) What usually happens is plot convulsion, deus ex machine resolutions, character regressions that make you wish you never started the trilogy to begin with.One of the main reasons I loved Into the Still Blue is Aria. Aria is the shiny, bright star for me. The kind of heroine girls and boys can look up to. While her personality is not the most unique (she doesn&#8217;t really jump off page,) it&#8217;s her intellect, persistence, abilities (mental & physical) that make me love her so much. Aria is fiercely independent, capable and strong. In this book, she demonstrates incredible amount of growth. From a scared, prejudiced and spoiled girl, she evolves into a capable young woman that others grow to love and respect. With so many people depending on her, she looks at the bigger picture and not once does she demonstrate selfishness or assert herself as a victim while others are suffering.Perry gets darker this time around. He has lost so many people in his life and has become immune to the concept of loss. It creates a rift between him and people he cares for but this is where relationship with Aria comes in place. She encourages him, gives him support when he needs it, doesn't judge him and lets him figure few things on his own. Aria and Perry have the kind of romance many of us can dream of. Aside from physical aspects... (Their physical chemistry still burns quite hot) it&#8217;s the bond between them that makes their romance sweet and poignant. The best part? Their love never defines them. It&#8217;s never the focus of the story and it never overshadows the plot. Both Aria and Perry rise above just being love interests to each other and become lovers, friends and partners in crime. They treat each other as equals. Love is supposed to exalt and dignify you&#8230;and that&#8217;s what Perry and Aria have in each other: someone you can lean your shoulder on when necessary and someone who believes in you.Aside from LIKEABLE, strong leads, Into the Still Blue utilizes its supporting and side characters very well. They are not plot devices used to compel the story but rather people, like Perry and Aria, who just want to see the next day. Soren, for example, goes from just a douchey bully, to a funny, conflicted character with his own set of problems. Roar goes through a period of severe depression because of Liv but his loyalty & friendship to Aria and Perry always remains the focus. I always feared the dreaded love triangle between Roar Aria and Perry, but Rossi is not about manipulating her readers with cheap tricks and tropes.Another reason why I enjoyed this book? No cardboard villains. They ALL have motivations, beliefs and reasons behind their actions. Sable is delusional, power hungry and manipulative. In his heart, he truly believes what he does is for the good and he is excellent at inducing fear into his subjects that takes form of false loyalty.SPOILER: In the end, when they finally reach the Still Blue, his control & division of people in order to establish a new society felt terrifying. His attempts to manipulate Aria with promises of brighter future while justifying murder and bloodshed made me feel uneasy. END SPOILER.The ending wasn't spectacular, I&#8217;ll admit to it. I wasn't blown away. It didn't have any shocking twists or revelations and I saw more than few things coming, but I still felt happy and satisfied with it. It was a journey that came to an end&#8230;and the Still Blue itself is a story for another time.",4.0
8918,"This book brought on the feels let me tell you. For those that like a good cry now and then this is the book for you. If you like a sad/happy stories, ones, that bring on an emotion deep and profound and makes you really truly think about your life and those you love around you then this is the book for you.I did not know a lot about this book. I try hard not to know what i'm reading before I read it so that I am not biased one way or the other. But I didn't think it would be an entire book of deep emotion. I didn't know it would be about a girl having to decide whether she should pass on or stay in this world.I listened to this book on audio today. Not only is the story fully charged with a sense of loss and love and joy, but it has a great sense of stillness as well. The narrator did an amazing job of giving voice to Mia. When she was breaking down while reading the story I too broke down. There was a lot of trembling lips and blurry eyes through out this book. As a mom to an 8 and 6 year old, I would lose my s*** if anything happened to them. As a sister, I would lose my s*** if anything happened to my siblings. As you age, you get a sense of nearing the edge. You are still on that cliff face but one strong wind will blow you over and you don't know when the storm will come. Love the ones you are with. It could be any moment and poof they are gone. You could be the one that leaves and your loved ones will be left behind. Give thanks to friends and family. Appreciate each moment, day, year that you have to spend with them.",4.0
8919,"Lundy has given us a new zom-poc series while we wait for Tufo, O'Brien and Chesser!  Granted there are other series out there but this one deserves more than just a look see.... While most concentrate on regular everyday people or retired soldiers or even ex Spec Ops, this one actually takes us to the heart of war. In this case in Afghanistan where a small group of soldiers on patrol find themselves cut off from their FOB Bremmel, they've lost more than half of their group and are on the run from an enemy they have no intel on. They make a run for Hairatan hoping to find answers and more importantly a safe place to get away from the large groups of 'Crazies' that have already decimated their group. Unfortunately Hairatan is also under siege and burning. When they finally find a way into the city and a warehouse where they take refuge they are contacted by a couple Seals who fill them in on what is going on. Completely cut off from the world they soon discover that in order to stay alive and possibly find a way back to the states they must now work with the Taliban to fight a common enemy far more dangerous than either could imagine. Its a non stop action packed story of survival and the beginning of a great new series.",5.0
8920,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.The first half of this book I thought was quite interesting. There was a good cast of characters and a fast-moving plot, but the second half I didn&#8217;t love quite as much. Fast-paced is always good for me, but the ending especially seemed quite rushed. There was also an odd plot twist that didn&#8217;t seem to fit with the overall theme of the story, and things got quite violent and didn&#8217;t make much sense to me. I enjoyed the dynamic between the two sisters (being a sister myself) but I didn&#8217;t think other relationships needed to be highlighted as much as they were. If the focus stayed on Gemma more I think it could have been a lot more interesting and easier to follow.",2.0

8924,"I appreciated Sproul weighing in on this topic. Those who have read other works on pro-life works (see my review of Scott Klusendorf's work) will not find anything dramatically new here. Yet it's good to read and review the pro-life's argument. One thing that stood out as unique in this book was actually George Grant's preface. Grant summarized the current landscape in our society, political sphere and culture as the result of the abortion debate since Roe vs. Wade. This fascinating essay filled with footnotes by Grant puts into perspective for the Christian the extent of how much the abortion controversy has seeped into so many spheres of our lives today. The book is worth reading for the preface alone. Getting into Sproul's actual work I do appreciate how the author does deal with various objections given against the prolife position. I was reminded that more women have been known to have been killed by abortion after Roe vs. Wade than before it which makes the back alley abortion argument for legalizing abortion kind of ironic. Concerning the argument that the fetus is part of the woman's body, Sproul bring modern study of cells to bear, noting that babies have a different genetic fingerprint than the mother. The more interesting part of the book is the appendix that ended up being a rather lengthy testimony of a medical expert on the status of the embryo. Perhaps a little too lengthy. Sproul could have had his arguments tighter and I say this because I've seen other works that have made it air tight in their presentation. For those who might want to read an introductory work or to remind and refresh their prolife apologetics I can recommend this work.",4.0

8927,"Okay, so. I don't know what made me read this book, because the synopsis is totally not my style. There are wayyyyy too many novels about peeps with &#34;broken pasts&#34; and the lovers that bring them back to life. Basically cliche upon cliche wrapped in a pretty new cover. But I bit the bullet and bought it.For a while, I was totally digging it. The angsty teen in high school, woe-is-me beginning was very reminiscent of novels past from Fictionpress, a website where some of my favorite authors first got their start. I initially was very excited to muddle through the lives of Bronagh and Dominic because of that fact.Bronagh is the one with the troubled past, as her parents were killed when she was young and she was brought up by her sister, Branna. This could have been extremely emotional and riveting, as it's been a successful ploy many-a-time, however it wasn't executed well. We're constantly told that Bronagh pushes people away and can't connect with any friends. And I say told because it's basically a textbook case of show, not tell. I couldn't connect with her at all on that point.She meets Dominic, one of five insanely hot brothers that move to Dublin (hear the cliche?) and he instantly wants her because she's the one woman to turn him down. I'll admit I did enjoy the bit of cat and mouse between them. Had Dominic actually possessed any redeeming qualities, I may have bought his douche-nugget routine. He constantly belittles and mocks the her to the point where I was giving my kindle serious WTF looks when she would stop-drop-and-roll in the middle of an argument to suck his tongue in her mouth.The entire plot was completely unbelievable; so much so that during the climax I was flipping through the pages in disbelief. Not only was the story a thin on plot, it also severely lacked in characterization. Dominic has to be one of the worst hero's since Travis Maddox. He, and I mean this literally, picked fights with people at least once during every. single. scene. Who does that? He had serious anger issues and in no way did I find that attractive. Nor was I fanning myself at the fact that he professes his love and then immediately speaks about babies and marriage. Hello, was I the only one with furrowed brows after that?So, in conclusion, a mildly entertaining, albeit absolutely unbelievable story that should be read if you don't really need a shot of realism to bring the characters to life. If you enjoy very &#34;lightweight&#34; novels that don't require a lot of thought and totally dig the uber-fake-alpha males that are also crazy and need to lay off the testosterone injections, snatch this up!",2.0

8937,"I will add Arlo Crawford to my list of favorite authors! Although I am pretty sure this is his debut novel, I certainly will look forward to further books by Arlo. His writing style is great and he makes you feel like one of his friends, who he is telling this story to. He is very honest about not wanting to follow his parents as to owning & running a productive farm as a business. He can see what it has done to them & so far, continues to do to them - the tedium work, constant pressure, demanding business that never lets up, dealing with hired hands, etc., etc.. He knows that there is a better way to make money, but that there is a certain love of a farm that surpasses other income avenues as well. He loves his farm; it's just that he sees the beauty more than the negatives that it holds. His descriptions of that beauty - the sights and smells of the farm & how it can get into your blood are wonderful and draw you in - I savored his depictions of what he felt as to the beauty side. But, a farm is really a LOT of work-more than he is willing to do endlessly! Frankly, I hated for this book to end. I could have read on and on, but sadly, it did end. I myself, grew up on a tiny 5 acre farm in rural Pennsylvania, on which we raised potatoes and chickens. Of course, we had other animals too, but they did not produce the same income that we had from the chickens. Even that was a lot of work, which I remember well. So, in some parts of his book, I could understand where Arlo was coming from and enjoyed that, now that I have so many years since that part of my life to remember.

8941,"&#8220;Friends from Damascus&#8221; is (more-or-less) part of the bigger story of the origins of the group of &#8220;rogue&#8221; assassins, known as Friends from Damascus, who take out world bad-guy terrorists, operating outside the boundaries and restraints of any national or political organization. Their funding remains mysterious, but their determination to kill terrorists who endanger civilization is clear and unambiguous. They simply kill them without much emotion connected to the assassinations. Naturally the entire world of terrorist organizations as well as legitimate governments seek them. Thus their operations are highly secretive. They live on the edge of exposure and their own annihilation.In this book, Mr. Happy traces the recruitment of two of the people who become primary players in the small group of self-appointed assassins, Brett/Rene and Talia/Mona. Naturally they become personally entangled and eventually in each other find the love that has escaped them all their lives. The first part of the book (about half) is slow and almost entirely &#8220;background.&#8221; Though necessary, it&#8217;s still slow.Mr. Happy has a tendency to create &#8220;superwomen&#8221; in all his books. Talia is no exception. She is a walking, talking, breathing death machine, with all the skills necessary to kill anyone she meets, besides being an emergency room doctor. But Talia nearly meets her maker in the book&#8217;s denouement in Lebanon.  However, as we read these thrilling episodes, Brett and his deadly-merry band of assassins eventually rescue her. Skipping ahead, Brett and Talia team up in all ways, and Talia joins the Friends&#8217; Group. This revelation is not a spoiler. It could not have happened in any other way, and such was obvious from the very beginning. How many people die in this book?  It&#8217;s an unbelievably high number!!Some of the action is a bit overboard and sketchy enough to cause the reader to suspend disbelief &#8211; not always possible for this reader.  Too much of the hairy escapes just don&#8217;t seem very possible and disbelief wins the day all too often. A writer shouldn&#8217;t force his readers to disbelieve plot and action episodes.And yet, it&#8217;s a very good story, very well-written, upbeat and assertively positive in its thrust with attempts at ethical reconstruction of behavior.  Mr. Happy may not write anything remotely resembling literature, but he writes a darn good story. It&#8217;s a bit like reading one of the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva, only with more technology and a staggeringly effective support group &#8211; and mercifully without the Israeli politics.Thus, it&#8217;s a 4 on Amazon&#8217;s scale.  The entire &#8220;Damascus&#8221; series is very well done. Kudos to Mr. Happy.",4.0

8945,"This is a very short story that not only introduces us to key characters in the Crimson Shadow series, but gives us important information about the purpose of the Odin clan. We meet Emily and Joseph Stryker when she finds him injured in an alley. After a few protestations that he would be fine, Joseph leaves the alley. Emily is confused by her reaction to him when she's never before felt drawn to a man showing interest in her.Back at the Odin clan's mansion, Joseph continues his work of building tolerance among the mythos community for more than just their own kind. With the help of his friend, Depok, they have been hard at work creating laws and establishing order in the mythos community. If they succeed, mythos everywhere will be safer and continue to remain secret from humans. Their efforts are hindered by rogues who see their way of life suppressed by this upstart clan and its leader.Complicating everything are the feelings Joseph and Emily have for each other, something forbidden since Emily is 100% human. But what good is any Crimson Shadow story without a bit of the forbidden to make things sweeter? Of course there's conflict, arrogance born of self-confidence in ones ability, nobility in striving to prevent friends from being injured or killed. And let's not forget Trepis, such a pretty ""kitty"" who behaves much like Emily's cat, Aries.I really enjoyed having this background on the Odin clan and what they were trying to accomplish. Their purpose echoes life in a very real way as they strive to better the world in which they live. They are attacked by a group who believes Stryker, and by extension the Odin clan, have no business trying to regulate how anyone in the mythos community live. Sound familiar?Of course it's not all smooth sailing, but it wouldn't be an interesting read if it was. The characters are, once again, wonderful, and the editing was nearly perfect. Very glad I added this book to my library. I'm looking forward to reading more from both this author and the world of Crimson Shadow.",4.0

I am normally not much of a historical romance reader. I typically like my books dark or hot and steamy, however this one was thrilling and enjoyable. I found myself wanting to keep turning pages to find out what would happen next with the differences in the towns people, as well as the romance going on with the two lead characters. The romance was sweet and I loved how forward the main characters were with their views during that time period. The acceptance and admiration, along with the constant denial of feelings for sake of the townships views made me fall even more for the story. Despite all the challenges, love and a little progress was made and the story ended with a HEA feel.Would recommend to anyone looking for a page turning sweet read.",5.0

Sheffield quickly calls on an old friend&#8212;a friend who happens to run a competing circus&#8212;for help.The Donovan crew head off to Grayson Circus to form an alliance in hopes of beating Medved, but end up getting the opposite of a warm welcome.While trying to win over the Grayson group, learning more secrets about her father daily, and fighting with her own feelings, Lucy is ready to explode.Will Medved and his army be enough to take her and her friends down?- - -What a follow-up!!! Gifted was great, but Burned?ASTOUNDING! Liz Long is quickly moving up in the ranks of my all-time favorite authors!The first thing I have to note is that the romance in this book is superbly done. I am so impressed with the fact that Liz didn't make it the focal point, but kept it alive with passionate and meaningful interactions between Lucy and both her love interests. I also like that I was surprised at her choice once it was made. I won't spoil it, of course, but I think you'll be surprised as well. I imagine it's quite a feat to keep up the suspense with both Gabriel and Keegan enough to make it realistic and yet still a surprise outcome. Does that make sense? I hope so. lol Anyway, the romance is beautiful and moving and very much heart-wrenching at times.After reading the first book in the series, the characters really stood out to me. I remember being impressed with the sheernumber of characters and how each one stood out so completely, remaining clear and memorable in my head even weeks after I read the book. We get all those same characters in this novel, plus some. With the Donovan crew spending a good portion of the book at the Grayson Circus, we meet new people! And the same thing happened with this book... I found them all SO SO memorable! Not only new characters, but new Gifts&#8212;some very interesting and fun ones at that. You can definitely expect new friends as well as enemies. :)Lucy is a lovable protagonist. I found that she really stepped up in this book. She was going through emotional turmoil for many different reasons, but embraced her role as leader even when she wanted to do anything but that. She never asked to be caught up in a war her father and Sheffield began. She never wanted to have to hurt someone using her Gift. She never asked for her Gift, period. But she grew. She learned. She overcame. She is inspiring and I very much enjoyed reading from her POV; enjoyed going on that journey of growth with her.As for the new villain. The Bear has quite a presence. This guy isn't just evil, he's freakin' insane! Sociopathic, even. He's definitely a memorable baddie! The action that accompanies his battle with Lucy and her friends is pure awesomeness. I felt like I was watching a movie. Liz did a perfect job of writing the action and keeping up the suspense. I was enthralled and glued to the pages.All in all, Burned left me completely satisfied. The characters, both old and new, are amazing and very stand-out among the hoards of New Adult characters out there. The romance is sexy and intense. The storyline progresses nicely and leaves things open for a third book without torturing us with a cliffhanger ending! Please bring on another Donovan Circus novel... like now! I definitely recommend this book (as well as Gifted) to anyone who enjoys a unique, fast-paced NA novel with a paranormal twist. :)",5.0

8951,I'm completely shocked that this was the ending to this series.  I loved the first two especially the love between four and tris it was exciting to see how they were so different but still loved one another thru it all.  I can not believe tris died and it was just like well that's it.  All the bad people got off for all they done while in my opinion the best character who done as much as she could for the people dies.  And a stupid death at that. She was finally happy to live and stopped going on suicide missions for the life and love she wanted.  But guess what nope didn't happen all the bad people got the life she help create but she got nothing.  I love romance stories but I also love action.. if your going to bring a romance into a book so strongly than don't disappoint.  Just really feel like blah over the ending just horrible!!!!,1.0

8955,"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Kay, or Katie, is a wealthy socialite living in Manhattan. Although her family comes from money, she doesn&#8217;t live the life of a trust fund brat, instead choosing to man the helm of her family&#8217;s charitable foundation (much to her mother&#8217;s chagrin). For the past three years she has been dating Josh, another trust fund brat (although estranged from his father) and they are engaged to be married. When she walks in on Josh and his former girlfriend, Kay realizes the mistake she is about to make and breaks it off.In order to help the austere Kay get over her breakup with Josh, her friend Michelle takes her to a sex club, Sensations (against Michelle&#8217;s better judgment). At the club, Kay has an anonymous sexual encounter with a man who upends her entire world. Even though their all-night sex session took place under the mask of darkness, she is immediately smitten. She remembers the smell of him, his voice. He too was electrified by their contact and can&#8217;t get her off her mind.Luke Davenport is the owner and CEO of one of the largest PR firms in Manhattan. He is still getting over the loss of his wife Roslyn, some four years earlier. He is the single father to a five-year-old daughter, Olivia, or Livy. When the fourth anniversary of his wife&#8217;s death rolls around, his friends and co-workers from the office manage to convince Luke to accompany them to Sensations. He, like Kay, is not looking for the kink that seems to be surrounding them at the club, but rather a night of hot companionship, some no strings attached hot sex with a stranger.The next day, the body of Ms. Carmen, the manager of the club is found strangled and soon Luke is arrested for the murder. Unfortunately, Kay is the only one that can serve as an alibi witness to Luke&#8217;s whereabouts, however in coming forward, she risks not only the name of her family, but her position with her family&#8217;s foundation as well. Can the connection between Kay and Luke be enough for Kay to risk it all? If Luke isn&#8217;t the one that killed Ms. Carmen, who is?Wrapped In Shadows is a book of suspense and mystery wrapped up in a hot romance package. The connection and resulting sexual encounters between Kay and Luke are hot. Luke is a hunk of an alpha male, not only because of his prowess in the bedroom and his dedication to Kay, but also in the commitment he has made to his daughter. She is the number one priority in his life and it is refreshing to see that.There are several twists and turns you won&#8217;t see coming, making this the proverbial page-turner. I loved the relationship between Kay and Michelle (who happens to work for Luke) and the different ends of the spectrum they represent. Michelle helps to draw Kay out of the vanilla, white bread world she is accustomed to and really live. Not only to experience the carnal pleasures of the world, but also to take the chance on real love, not the kind that is more of a business merger between families, meant to benefit them socially and financially. Kay wants to marry for love, not power.Wrapped In Shadows is a solid four star read. It is gripping and well written, however I could have done without some of the back and fourth angst between not only Kay and Luke, but Kay and her mother as well. Kay isn&#8217;t the strongest of heroines and I would have liked her a bit more if she had more of a backbone. In the end she pulled it off and got it together, but I feel I may have had more of a connection with her if it had been earlier in the book. Ms. Eugene did an excellent job of creating the villain(s) and making their motivations clear. I think the biggest thing that bothered me though was Luke&#8217;s daughter, Livy. I loved their relationship, but it was the way in which Ms. Eugene depicted her with her speech that made it a little unbelievable. As a five year old, there was an awful lot of baby talk, but in the next chapter, she busts out the line of &#8220;who are these men?&#8221; For the most part her language seemed to be that of a 2-3 year old, not that of a kindergartner.Wrapped In Shadows is a standalone with an HEA. I highly suggest it for fans of romantic suspense. This is the first book I&#8217;ve written by Ms. Eugene and certainly not the last.",4.0

The heroine, Kaelyn, is so sexually naive and ultra privileged that there is no way she would be rolling around on the floor surrounded by 5 guys doing her after meeting them 2 days before.

8957,"Having been a family victim of a murder, I was fascinated in reading this novel that was written by a federal judge who has presided over a capital murder case.&#34;The Hanging Judge&#34; is the debut thriller by Michael Ponsor. It is excellent in many ways. It gives readers a view and perspective of courtroom drama in a capital murder case, along with what might and sometimes does happen behind the scenes.Personally, I am a lot like the main charater, David Norcross. I also have a lot of deep doubts about our legal system. Being a crime victim, I resent a clever defense attorney getting a criminal off the hook, when the villain is obviously very guilty.  However, I know that both the prosecutor and defense attorney are just doing the best job they can.Reading this novel was akin to watching a movie and not being able to do anything else until seeing what happens in the end. In a fiction movie or a fiction novel, writers can make their story have a good ending. Truth is, in reality, the bad guys don't always get what is coming to them. However, it could be a different matter when wicked people die - for this is not a free ride - everyone must pay for their deeds - good or bad.If you want to read a book that has lots of action and one that stirs up emotions, then you should read this excellent and well-written novel.Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) &#34;Fighting the Devil&#34; - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder",5.0

8960,"I'm a huge fan of Kristen's and have been for years but recently I must admit I've been disappointed with Own the Wind and Fire Inside and I didn't even consider reading Jagged but since I love the Fantasyland Series not reading Broken Dove wasn't an option.This book started really well, I loved all the characters involved and Kristen was weaving her magic, normally I read quickly which is both a blessing (I get to the end quicker so find out what's what) and a curse (if it's a good book it's over too quickly) but in this case due to personal issues it's taken me days to get through this which means I've been able to really get into it, and I was but I did take issue with Maddie's stupid mistake, now I know Maddie had to do something to annoy Apollo but I didn't find it believable, this is a woman who's street wise and has been on the run from her husband for years so I felt this was a cheap shot and I expect more from Kristen.I loved that all the main characters from the past books were here with their children.Golden Dynasty is one of my favourite Kristen books I can't remember how many times I've actually read this book, I also loved Wildest Dreams but Fantastical was for me a disappointment.One measure I use when judging books is if I'd read it again and to be honest I don't know if this is a book that I would read again, I'm not sure why but at the moment I can't see it happening, it makes me wonder where the four stars came from even though I loved the characters and enjoyed the book for me it was lacking something, I'm not sure what but it makes me wonder if we do in fact have the old Kristen back. I am concerned that Kristen's books of late are not living up to earlier potential, this one started really well and I liked all the characters but it's not calling out for me to re-read, now I know not every book can be everything to every reader but I'm wondering if she's spreading herself too thin she has a lot of different series's going on at the moment I know I'm waiting for the next 'burg book as well as The Third Series.This book has reminded me how much I liked Frey and Finnie as well as Apollo so I'm going back to re-read Wildest Dreams now which of course will be followed by Golden Dynasty yet again.I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars. I gave 4 since I liked the characters and enjoyed the book but if I compare it to At Peace, Until the Sun Falls from the Sky, Golden Dynasty, Motorcycle Man the list goes on and on it makes me wonder if it truly deserves the 4 stars, would 3 be a more accurate rating?",4.0

I don't think I've ever read a book where I rooted for the characters as much as I did this book. The characters are amazing. They are real, they are vibrant and you really believe they exist somewhere out there. The storyline is so well developed, and so well written that it just draws you right in, and doesn't let go!Who hasn't wished that someone who was bugging them wasn't there any longer?  I know I have... and I hate to think about how I would feel if something truly did happen to that person, the guilt would be overwhelming.  That's exactly what the author portrays, and very eloquently in this book.  It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, love, hate, grief, loss and most of all, hope.I'm a teacher, and always looking for something my reluctant readers will enjoy... this is it!

8975,"In life, we hear voices. No, not the ones you may be thinking about. Voices of fear, doubt, accusation and more. These are the voices that Steven Furtick addresses in his new book Crash The Chatterbox: Hearing God&#8217;s Voice Above All Others. I am grateful to Multnomah for giving me a free copy to review.First, the things I enjoyed about the book. This book will be very helpful to many. The book is geared for those who are struggling. Struggling with doubts, fears, and more. It is encouraging. It is honest. It is Biblical. If you find yourself struggling with some of these &#8220;voices,&#8221; this book will be an encouragement.Secondly, there were a few things I did not care for personally. This book is different from Furtick&#8217;s first two. His first two is built around Biblical stories, this is not. The book is Biblical, but there is a little too much psychology for my taste. I would have rather it be built around a character like his last books. It is not bad by any means, I just felt like the flow of the last books was much better than this one. It personally did not scratch me where I itch, but I know that many will find this very helpful and encouraging.All in all, this is not a bad book at all.

Brando and Shea are an interesting pair, and the way they are brought together brought on some sparks. Some in a good way. Some...not so much.

8984,"After reading book 3 of this series I commented that, &#8220;There was less action this time around, and I admit I'm hoping book four ramps things up a bit.&#8221;  It seems Ms. Jacobey was listening, as book 4, EXPOSED, moves Tori back into her old renegade world, whether she likes it or not.  Hence, there&#8217;s plenty of danger and intrigue for her to deal with, as well as a new-found family tie.  She also has to do some soul searching about what and who she really is and what she really wants,  while also coming to terms with abilities and desires that she is, intellectually, not completely at ease with.  She&#8217;s learning something we all have to learn-- to embrace our darker side and accept that&#8217;s also an integral 'part' of who we are but doesn't completely define us.  These elements make the book somewhat grittier than the last one, which will please most fans of this series, I think.  Of course, the book ends on a cliffhanger.  Once again, we are given a glimpse of just how deep the rabbit hole may go as we witness the forces that surround Tori as they discuss their nefarious plans.  There&#8217;s still a lot of mysteries to be solved, and a long road for Tori to travel before she has true freedom from her past so she can build a new and better future with the man she loves.",4.0

This book begins in the airport, while Kayla is waiting to board a plane to go to her younger sister's wedding.  Kayla is not looking forward to the trip, because she know's her parents will be constantly harassing her about having a boyfriend.  Kayla has it all thought out.  She has a made up boyfriend, but no one she can take on the trip with her.  To top it off, she has a fear of flying, so she is going stir crazy while waiting to board the plane.  In walks the dashing, incomparable, Cooper Shillings, who begins a banter with the unassuming Southern beauty and gets drawn in to her innocence and her beautiful legs for miles.Cooper realizes that Kayla is afraid of flying, and he is a sucker for a beautiful damsel in distress.  So, when he finds out she has a first class ticket, he goes to the counter and trades in his coach seat so he can be in the seat next to her to help her through her fear.  Kayla is a self-reliant woman who knows what she wants, and also knows that she doesn't need a man to help complete her.  Cooper is an ex-marine with his own baggage, and they are both commit-a-phobics.  Before you know it, Cooper has Kayla thinking of other things...way hotter things...than flying.  She gets drunk on the plane and all her insecurities are forgotten with one kiss from this sexy-swoon worthy ex-marine.  He lays the charm on thick and before you know it, they decide that he will act as her boyfriend for the weekend.  What could go wrong, right?!  They both are all in for this short wild ride, and I do mean ride ladies...of a lifetime.Cooper has convinced himself that he doesn't need anyone in his life and he has a lot of guilt over the war. He thinks he is damaged goods.  He has a soft spot for people in trouble, and Kayla has him whirling. Cooper helps Kayla lose all her inhibitions and the two of them have some earth shattering, mind blowing, up close and personal sexcapades in very public places!!!  Cooper was sensual, hot, mesmerizing, tantalizing, and oozing sex appeal in every way possible!  This was a fast paced, quick read novella, full of excitement, and the thrills kept coming.

You can save yourself time and money by reading the teaser chapters or perhaps you'll decided it's for you. The h interviews for a job with the world famous, reclusive author, who has come to live in her small town to get away from the press. She's up against her 2 best friends, who never said anything to her. It's one of the most immature things I've ever read. I felt like the story should have been set in high school. The way the H and h interact throughout the book, is like 2 teenagers, who alternate between talking and not talking to each other. I'm never a fan of a character who is in another relationship whilst the story is developing between the leads. We read about her having sex with her boyfriend near the beginning and the relationship continues through a large part of the book. It was tacky and verged on cheating.

I have been reading this book non-stop for the last week and have lived in the 1700's. I've lived through ship wrecks, plagues, kidnappings, gone to fancy parties, found lost loves, been lost at sea, chased by soldiers, jumped ship, slept under the stars in fields of heather, made love to my husband, witnessed bravery, love and loss....it's been a busy week. :)  I love the way Diana Gabaldon writes. Her books envelope me and I feel like I'm standing on the cliffs of Scotland, smelling the salt air of the ocean, the rancid smell of death, see and feel the stone path or there are times I have to take a drink of water for one of the characters is thirsty.

9000,"This was a real page turner.  Debbie has an epiphany of sorts when she is on the set with her latest adult film. Returning home, she discovers her husband has died with a underaged girl. The two were electrocuted while filming the girl's ""audition"" in a hot tub. Only this could happen in Hollywood. Debbie is left with a huge debt of her husband's and a local thug named Richard Ness is threatening to kill her if she doesn't make good on the debt. Debbie, feisty and strong, pretty much tells him where to go. She decides she's had enough of the adult film industry and wants out. She embarks on a journey to reconnect with her family while planning her husband's funeral. One would think her late husband was a dog, but it turns out he really cared for Debbie and was kind to her. For all his flaws, he was a decent husband. Ness sells her debt to a mean thug named Coco Manetti, who tries to collect any way possible. Luckily Debbie discovers she has an unexpectedly powerful friend on her side who ends up helping her out.The characters are colorful and well-developed. I like the fact there's a gay character who loves theater; you might think he's a stereotype, but he ends up being far from that once you learn more about him. You can just visualize them from Mosley's descriptions. Although a bit raw at times, Debbie's story has a gritty realness but in the end, she manages to triumph, but not in the way you might expect. I like how Debbie evolves and grows during the story; in spite of what happens, she remains strong and committed to starting a new life. This story draws you in right from the start, and like me, you won't be able to put it down once you start.",5.0
9001,"The title initially refers to the ranking system prevalent among pupils in the boarding schools of the time. As the harrowing story progresses however the word reverts to its more derogatory connotation.The exquisite style of the writing belies the underpinning malevolence of the plot, I found myself rereading paragraphs relishing the sheer elegance of the narrative while paradoxically dreading discovering what indignities the characters were going to have to endure next.The main impact of the book lies in the author&#8217;s portrayal of the use, misuse and interplay of power between both pupils and masters which leads to treachery, prejudice and ultimately tragedy.On recommending this novel to friends and colleagues in the equality and diversity field I don&#8217;t think I exaggerated when I described it as a modern masterpiece.",5.0

9005,"THE STORY:In IMMAGICA, Rosaline Clayton is given an amulet by her father for her 15th birthday. He tells her to find the book in the attic and go to Immagica, to save the magical world, and himself. She doesn't understand anything that's going on. When Rosaline and her brother Elliot find the book, they are taken into Immagica but are separated. There she meets fantastical creatures and makes new friends, all the while trying to find her little brother. But in order to find him, she needs to defeat the dragon terrorizing the realm. But there is more to the dragon than she could have ever imagined, and she learns things about her family that are better left in the dark.I absolutely LOVED IMMAGICA! I'd say that IMMAGICA is more like an epic fantasy than just regular old fantasy, because well it's EPIC! We have a young girl coming of age, being taken to a magical world and meeting magical creatures, who goes on a journey or quest to save the world from destruction. IMMAGICA drew me in and I didn't want to stop reading. I sincerely hope that this will be made into a series, because I would love to read more adventures in Immagica.THE CAST:Rosaline: Our heroine just turned 15 years old, and was given her birthrights after overhearing some strange things her parents were discussing behind closed doors. She enters Immagica with a troubled mind and heart and just wants to find her brother and go home. But as she travels Immagica and meets it's citizens and the beauty that could be destroyed, she realizes that she can't let this world and it's people die.Elliot: He shares the same birthday as his sister Rosaline, but is two years younger. He gets sucked into Immagica along with Rosaline, but is separated from her when they arrive. While Rosaline's story is playing out, Elliot's own story is being written.Brynn: She is the first person Rosaline meets in Immagica. They don't exactly hit it off at first, but as they journey, they form a strong friendship and loyalty to each other.Ira: He is the black unicorn that Rosaline called to her so she could travel easier. The bond that Ira and Rosaline form is very, very strong, and I doubt it can ever be broken.Sebille & Orin: The fairies! These two are always playing with Rosaline's hair and poking her in the cheeks, but don't let their carefree appearance fool you. They have their own magic and strengths that you wouldn't expect from such tiny creatures. They love Rosaline very deeply.Lex: The Protector of the very heart of Immagica. He's cute with his geeky quirkiness, but when it comes to the protection of the Eye, he won't let anything threaten it. The Eye holds all the knowledge of Immagica, everyone who has ever visited has their book there. There's a little crush formed between him and Rosaline (and let's just say it's reciprocated).The Dragon: I don't want to say too much about him because it would give a lot away, but he's the bad guy trying to destroy Immagica.THE VILLAIN:As I mentioned above, the dragon is the villain of this tale. He's trying to destroy Immagica and is evil to the core. He has the gryphons working for him on destroying the towers surrounding the Eye. All of them have fallen but the North Tower. The dragon has a surprising connection with the Clayton family.THE ROMANCE:There isn't much romance in IMMAGICA, until Rosaline and her friends reach the Eye and she meets Lex, the protector. And even then it's just little hints. But that's what made it so perfect. It was that awkward moment when a crush is first formed, and there's all the nervousness and blushing. It was just all around sweet and I really want to see more between these two (hint hint series).THE ACTION:There are epic battles all around in IMMAGICA. But it was the battle with the dragon toward the end that really stands out, as it should. That fight was one of the moments in the book that really had me on the edge of my seat and holding my breath waiting for the outcome. And that's all I'm going to say about that, so if you want to see how it ends, you should pick up this AMAZING book!",5.0

9011,"I bought this book after, once again, falling in love with the cover. I actually spotted this book about a month ago when I was gearing up for my 2014 Reading Challenge of 100 books. I was not too enamored with the plot, since I had no idea what it was about, but something in me was excited to read this book.And there are 5 reasons why this book did not work for me.1. It's a lot like the Hunger Games, After the Fear, Vampire Academy and Enclave, but it doesn't deliver (as my post title suggests).The main character, Amy, is supposed to be like Katniss in the Hunger Games, but her character development was seriously lacking. I mean, the girl was tough and did whatever she could for Baby, but sometimes she acted in ways that didn't make sense. Example, Amy's supposed to be hardened from living in the After, but she feels guilt when she sets Them on the man that was going to rape her? Ummm...okay.Now let's talk about this books relation to After the Fear. After the Fear was a brilliantly plotted book with a strong main character and a little romance to keep us interested. Now, the place where In the After went wrong with this connection to After the Fear is the awkward insta-romance between Amy and Rice. I mean, come on. So she just learned to lean on him when needed, reveal her soul to him, and just love him without much effort? That is not real life.Now let's talk about Vampire Academy. I kind of had the feeling that some of the snarky comments made by Amy were supposed to be super funny and witty like Rose from VA, but all of them (literally ALL of them) fell flat.Enclave. Good ol' Enclave. I felt the writer tried hard to write succinctly like Ann Aguirre, but all she managed to do was make me feel detached from her characters (which I go into more detail below).2. I literally felt nothing for these characters. Even Baby.I don't feel the writer developed the characters enough to make me have a real enough connection with the characters. Any of them, well minus Kay, but only because in my mind she's a super hot version of Pearl from the Vampire Diaries (the TV show version). And I'm just into women, to put it lightly. Any ways, I felt the writer tried to &#34;show&#34; the relationship between everyone in the book, but she missed many valuable opportunities to show true emotions in the characters. I mean, how is that Amy could leave her dad behind so easily when he seems to be such a large part of her?3. The way the book was structured made my stomach hurt.If you've read But I Love Him by Amanda Grace (which is a good book) you're familiar with books that start from the end and work to the beginning. Well, In the After does both. Yeah, you heard me; it does both. The story is told from the beginning, giving a break down of what happened in the world; but during all of this, the story is told from the POV of Amy who's in the Ward. I have a feeling this was meant to be ground breaking and moving, but mostly it was just annoying.4. The information spills.I'm a huge history person, but the way information was spilled on me ALL AT ONCE made my head hurt. I mean, there was no &#34;breaking it to them gently&#34; in this book. When it came to revelations and twists, so much information was revealed the real effect of the information was lost. This book literally had SO MUCH potential, but it fell flat so many times.5. It felt a little too &#34;I'm writing for the next book&#34; for me.Many things were left open in this book. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought series were supposed to be able to stand on their own if the first book didn't do very well?Overall, I finished this book in one day, but not because I loved it. This book was interesting, the plot idea was fresh and new, but the material was so stale there was no substance for me to get caught up on. I mean, this is a 400+ page book, yet I finished it so fast because the writing is so...fluffy. And not in a good way.Now, I do plan on reading the next book (since I'm doing a reading challenge), but I do not necessarily recommend this book.",3.0
9012,"Americanah made for an extensive and interesting discussion in our book club.  It's the book most explicitly focused on race that we've read (complementing the more novelistic Age of Iron and Continental Drift) over our 14 years.  It had us contemplating more deeply subjects that are all around us every day, in a way that Animal, Vegetable, Miracle had us really thinking about food.  This book had us thinking about the day-to-day issues surrounding hair, for example.  So the book was most appreciated for its ideas.  And we also liked its structure/style, incorporating blog postings to complement the story line and to bring home what the central character thinks about, and what she does for a living.  But the plot seemed more opinion -- a long essay -- than a novel.  And the central character was rather frustrating with her personal decisions that weren't well explained.  All-in we were all glad that we read it (or at least talked about it, as applicable...), and gave it an average grade of around B+, in a range of B- to A-.  In any event, we did have a very nice evening together.  And I have some leftover pasta for lunch today.",4.0

9014,"After reading A Casual Weekend Thing and Holding Out for a Fairy Tale, I knew that I really liked this author. Sex & Sourdough surpassed my expectations. It was a thoroughly touching and heartwarming read. I loved every moment. I often find that books have themes, and I'd say the theme of Sex & Sourdough is living life. One foot in front of the other, just keep moving.Anders, though he doesn't realize it until later, has been in an abusive relationship for nearly three years. From the outside, it seems like it should be obvious, but strangely, it isn't always, at least when it's happening to you. People rationalize, both not wanting to feel weak and not wanting to be seen as weak, so their abusers get much further than they should. Luckily, Anders manages to get a taste of what life without Joel is like and breaks up with him before it's too late.Kevin, aka Sourdough, befriends Anders when he starts hiking, and undoubtedly keeps him safe and alive. He also gives Anders the experience he needs to figure out what he want to do with his life. Through the way Kevin deals with his own problems, and still manages to put one foot in front of the other, Anders sees that he can live his life as well, even if he hasn't quite figured out what he wants to do with it.Once I started reading this book, I really could not put it down. It made me smile and it made me cry (though my tears were not for what I expected them to be for) and then smile again. This book will definitely go on the reread list.",5.0

9017,"*contains spoilers* Definitely one of the best reads I had in a while. Mythology had always been my favorite and I tend to read Mythology-based novels after reading Mythology by Edith Hamilton. Deer in Headlights did not disappoint. I find the idea of the gods of Olympus playing a game novel and interesting. The subplots/backstories added more meat/substance and had no issues with the characters or how they were characterized. Love the lines/dialogues. I definitely saw/read distinct or unique individuals. Their struggles and how they responded to their inner and outer conflicts were rather understandable (though I do not believe in superstition but a superstitious person would definitely act they way she did given his past). It is also nice to note or to discover that the goddess of love and beauty might have problems with love. I also felt for Apollo and his Daphne. The author's take on their story was a nice treat. The way it was presented - the narration, the pacing, the flow - was just right and could be improved, perhaps tone down repetitions in the exposition . I can't wait to know what happens next.

And the things that he does just to tried to break them apart Ben just disappoint me.I really love the character of Grace but she also made me mad but for only like to second. I had to understand that she is a mother, and the way that her characters turned out to be it broke my heart.I really did enjoy reading this book, and can't wait to read the rest of this series, once again I have to say Author Kim Karr THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING ME TO THIS AMAZING CHARACTERS AND THIS AWESOME BOOK.",5.0

9037,"I absolutely am enamored with Paloma Beck's writing style and her ability to balance sex and romance. This book tackles the lifestyle of Domestic Discipline with grace and dignity, adding elements of D/s and BDSM but not at the risk of the story. The underlying theme I pick up is tenderness and care. The lead couple is extremely compelling, their back stories are explored and fit the picture of who they are at this point in time and explains their actions and reactions.  Their journey to happily ever after is well plotted and satisfying. Oh, and it looks like there is a sequel. I look forward to revisiting this couple and their world.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.",4.0

9039,"What a great read, and so informative too. It's rare that someone of Ferreira's technical caliber (he's a professor of astrophysics at the prestigious University of Oxford) can also write well. Note that, at the time of this review, he has over 360 published items (e.g., articles, books) and he is cited over 1300 times in other works. Nowhere does he use the title &#34;Doctor,&#34; and I couldn't find any reference thereof. But in trying to find it, I was duly impressed with his credentials otherwise. Maybe that's why he's a professor at a major university even if (and that's not certain) he doesn't have a PhD (he might, I just can't verify that).His writing is excellent, both in style and in technical merit (that is, his grammatical competence is high). Because of this, the book is quite accessible to the lay reader with an interest in something as mind-boggling as the Theory of General Relativity. Rather than trudging through dense text and trying to figure out what the author is saying, readers of this book can enjoy a nicely narrated explanation of what has gone on with the Theory of General Relativity from its inception to where it is today.In this review, I won't explain anything about this very famous theory. I assume the reader of this review has not been on a deserted island since 1905 and thus has been amply exposed to it through at least some of the pop culture, thousands of articles, common mentions, and even movies that have explained, amplified, or even misrepresented it since that time. If you were stranded on a deserted island all this time, please accept my apologies; I did not mean to slight you.This book isn't a tutorial on the Theory of General Relativity. Whatever you know of it from the popular culture or the reading of relevant books for the layperson is sufficient background for reading this book. It's really about the human drama that this theory evoked. And that is quite a story. As Ferreira tells us in the Prologue and then shows us through his writing, the Theory of General Relativity has taken on a life of its own. It occupied, or perhaps consumed, many of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century. And it is a career topic for many brilliant minds in this century.In telling this story, Ferreira delves into how science and culture have responded to the Theory of General Relativity. But his focus is mostly on the scientists, with their cliques, battles of ideas, and personal feuds. The intrigues and backstabbing have much in common with a season of the 80's television show Dallas. People who challenged the orthodoxy or the &#34;powers that be&#34; sometimes found their lives destroyed (even though they were right).What many people don't know is the Theory of General Relativity actually fell by the wayside in the larger physics community, and stayed in the ditch for many years. Then suddenly, it made a big comeback. It's now central to emerging science. As Ferreira so deftly shows us, the Theory of General Relativity has value in taking us further in both physics and cosmology.When the topic of a book is the Theory of General Relativity, perhaps the most relevant question a reviewer can answer is, &#34;What about the math?&#34; Being a quant myself (MBA, with an engineering undergrad), I happen to like math. Use math to explain something to me, and you help me understand. Except when it comes to the strange, very advance, mind-numbing math used by physicists and their ilk. Count me out. Ferreira does the reader the favor of not trying to prove he's an egghead. There's no math to mystify the reader. Just a great story, well-told.Just as an example of the threads that Ferreira pursues in this book, consider black holes. These are mentioned in several chapters, and of course you know that means he talks about Stephen Hawking. The drama around this one celestial object makes for a story in itself. It was that story that made Hawking a pop icon. &#34;Hawking radiation&#34; solved a major puzzle regarding black holes.This book consists of 14 chapters across 235 pages. In addition, it has an informative Prologue, extensive notes, and an impressive bibliography.Technical note on this review:I reviewed a paperback Advance Reading Copy for Amazon Vine. Normally, these advance copies are rife with copy editing errors. That was not at all the case with this one. Over the past few years, I've noticed a distinct difference between authors from the UK and those from the USA, in terms of understanding and implementing Standard Written English (SWE). Sad to say, my countrymen do quite poorly in this regard, nearly every time. Ferreira is a UK author, and his writing reflects the much higher standards there.A disclaimer at the front said there may be corrections. As I write this review, I cannot recall a single error of either a technical or style nature. Well done, Mr. Ferreira.",5.0

Will they find their way back to each other, or will his need for revenge outweigh the love he feels in her arms?My Thoughts: Gemma, a woman with lots of strengths and courage, was rather impetuous early in the story. Even so, she was a women that I could relate to. Shattered heart as a young girl, but not shattered spirit. She rose to the occasion helping take care of her younger sister and learned what she could in managing a castle. Family was vitally important to her and when needed she heeded her father&#8217;s words.Both Gemma and Nicholas were hiding the truth from themselves, something we all do from time to time. Nicholas thought he was ONLY following the edicts of the king to go to Blackstone Castle and bring order to a serious situation. But he went to see Gemma wanting to exact revenge for his family betrayal. His family had suffered much from some trickery from Gemma&#8217;s family if not she herself. On the other hand, Gemma had been told the story that Nicholas&#8217;s family had tried to take her family down. In other words, she felt betrayed and would never seek another man as she had when young. They were not to be trusted.The king meant for them to wed and they could not refuse the king. The inner struggle each had not trusting the other from the past to the physical attraction present long ago and apparently still remains makes for a rocky start to any relationship. Nicholas, a knight in every sense of the word, had a job to do -- protect the castle, protect Gemma AND we found protect his heart. He sacrificed his own desires and almost sacrificed himself when he lost control and wasn&#8217;t able to protect anything at all. Gemma was willing to marry Nicholas to have protection for herself and her family. She knew that Nicholas would never be able to love her nor was she able to protect her heart. He loved. She loved. And neither understood anything. This plot made for an interesting and entertaining read.The story was evenly paced and complex enough to be interesting with a suspenseful feeling lurking since we don&#8217;t know why people are being killed. The formal medieval dialog helped provide a medieval setting. The story was a clean read.I think the story itself has opportunities for more turmoil creating further suspense and conflict between Gemma and Nicholas. And by doing so it gives the reader further insight into the primary characters of the read. On a couple of occasions I had difficulty accepting as factual what Gemma would do to bring herself into danger. She put herself into danger with little thought, yet I pictured her as intelligent and strong-willed with a good head on her shoulders. However, that being said, I enjoyed how she maneuvered to remove herself from danger and her repentance afterwards.All in all, I enjoyed and liked the story and know that Amy Mullen has a future in historical romance writing. It was an excellent first novel. For further information about the book or read an excerpt see earlier posting [...]",4.0

Her biological family is in and out of her life. She moves around a lot and is able tobe the glue that holds many of her loved ones together.

9065,"Forty years ago we last stepped foot on the Moon. Currently, with our occupation of the low-Earth orbit international space station, we are space residents. In the visionary Mission to Mars (National Geographic Society, 2013), moon-walker, space advocate, Gemini 12 and Apollo 11 astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, challenges us to take a further step and colonise Mars. Aldrin advocates bypassing the Moon and instead make progressive steps to mars via comets, asteroids and Mar&#8217;s moon Phobos. From Phobos astronauts using remote controlled robots will prepare the Mars landing site and habitats. Aldrin states that regular space travel to Mars would be too expensive with Apollo-style modular expendable components, instead favoring a gravity-powered spaceship cycling permanently between the Earth and Mars. Although strongly advocating for a US led enterprise Aldrin, thankfully, sees cooperation, rather than competition with China, Europe, Russia, India and Japan as being the way forward.Currently we have the Dutch company Mars One are recruiting people to be part of a permanent human settlement on Mars by 2023; the US commercial firm SpaceX have their Red Dragon proposal to put a sample-return mission to Mars by 2018 (seen as a necessary precursor by NASA to a human exploration); the Chinese have a long term plan for non-crewed flights to Mars by 2033 and crewed phase of missions to Mars during 2040-2060. Although the funding mechanisms and motivations are different these plans all make use of one idea or more from book The Case for Mars (Free Press, 1996, 2011). Written by aerospace engineer and founder of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, it is a meticulous and plausible way to settle Mars. Aldrin&#8217;s book is more broad and his ideas fit well with current technologies, US aspirations for asteroid capture and exploitation, and NASA&#8217;s focus on the planet Mars.The veteran Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, is still surprising us with its discoveries, more than nine years after the completion of its 90 day primary mission. While the sprightly youngster Curiosity is regularly rewriting and deepening our understanding of Mars - still only half-way through its three year primary mission.Appreciating what it takes to get a scientific laboratory wheeling its way across Mars is enticingly portrayed in another  new book Red Rover (Basic Books, 2013). This first-hand account is written by Roger Wiens, lead scientist for ChemCam - the laser zapping remote chemical analytical instrument onboard the rover Curiosity. It covers his involvement in robotic space exploration from his initiation in 1990 on the NASA Genesis probe to the joyous moment when Curiosity zapped its first rock in early 2013. If this piques your curiosity then the earlier Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the exploration of the Red planet (Scribe, 2005) is well worth tracking down. A passionate insight into the  2004 twin rover Spirit and Opportunity mission by Steve Squyres, the mission&#8217;s scientific principal investigator.These robotic missions are prudent preparatory steps to Aldrin provides and engaging overview of the technical, economic and political reasons for humanity to journey to Mars. It has been a self-professed vision of his since his return from the Moon. This books, though, represents Aldrin&#8217;s first attempt to put the whole of the puzzle, his Unified Space Vision, together in one place. For a more technical read on the settlement and exploration of Mars then Zubrin&#8217;s revised and updated The Case for Mars (Free press, 2011) and Marswalk One: first steps on a new planet (Praxis, 2005) by astronautical historian, writer and designers David Shayler, Andrew Salmon and Michael Shayler are also recommended. Mission to Mars though is a clarion call, essential reading for anyone interested in humanity&#8217;s next big step.This review was first published on dragonlaughing",4.0

9069,"I had to think long and hard about what I wanted to write for my review.  The author makes a point several times in her book to say that it is easier to criticize then be uplifting and happy.However I will start with a little criticism and finish with happy.  I found that author to be a generally negative person who portrays herself as someone who snaps at people a lot of generally has a negative, or critical attitude.  Those things really put me off from the book and at times I wondered why I was punishing myself to finish the book.However I did glean several things from it:1) a recommendation of the next book I want to read &#34;The Story of a Soul&#34;2) I learned that hugging for 6 seconds is the minimum to gain the positive effects from the action3) To remember that the years are short4) Enjoy the present5) Portraying yourself as happy can indeed make you happierI don't want to continue for it might spoil the rest of the book.I struggled with whether to say I would recommend this book.  Initially I would have said &#34;HECK NO&#34; but after completion I think there are plenty of people who can relate to her and take up some of her suggestions.  She can be a bit repetitive and can at times seem trite with the things she did...but this was HER project and these were things that she thought might make HER happy (I wouldn't need to copy them exactly myself just the spirit would need to be imitated).So I say yes I would recommend it but read it in small doses :)",3.0

Because with unending love comes a willingness to forgive.,5.0
9090,"I think that Lorraine Sinkler has done an amazing job in collating and writing this biography of a man who has inspired so many seekers on the Path. He is revealed as a down-to-earth, sometimes exacting man who pursued illumination from a young age. His single-minded devotion to his Inner Voice may have wavered sometimes, revealing that self-doubt is a necessary evil to awaken us to our human follies when we forget to trust implicitly. Joel Goldsmith was an extraordinary man whose life and message has stood the test of time; eschewing any formal organization to be established, he knew that his lessons and writings would be open to the interpretation of those following him, and that ego, that ever-present, demanding part of ourselves is too easily swayed by the need for praise and glorification. For this reason, his teachings are as vital today as when they were first presented, and remain undiluted Truths and a profound way for us to achieve Grace.",5.0

9095,"Interesting premise - reminded me a bit of The Chronicles of Narnia with different worlds behind woodwork. I found it somewhat slow-paced with the action only picking up almost towards the middle of the book. Even then, the plot didn't really go anywhere deep - just a glimpse inside a few of the cupboards, an entrance of a villain, with the end of the book coming on too quickly with a unsatisfying conclusion. Yet, the characters are endearing (especially Uncle Frank). This is definitely a cliff-hanger book. It kept me interested enough to want to continue with the series, but I could only give it 4 stars because I felt that book should have been longer to include more story or the action could have developed sooner.",4.0

9103,"Aaah, so lovely to get reacquainted with one of my favorite book couples, Ethan and Brynne. Though at first, I just didn't see why they needed another book. Eyes Wide Open ended in a really good place. But Rare and Precious Things by Raine Miller takes you beyond the epilogue, and shows the intense love and longing the couple has for each other. It shows them growing, both as individuals, as a couple, and as parents.Rare and Precious Things is NOT a stand alone, but if you haven't read The Blackstone series, you must.Likes:&#8226;I love visiting with my favorite dirty-talking Brit!&#8226;Tons of character growth.&#8226;A nice look back at their meeting from Ethan's POV.&#8226;Enough flashbacks to catch you up to speed if you, like me, forgot a lot of details.&#8226;The overwhelming, all-encompassing love that the couple has for each other.&#8226;Ethan becomes a daddy, and an awesome one (of course).&#8226;Fan's of Raine's historicals will love the big tie-ins!Dislikes:&#8226;The first &#8531; was very slow for me, it was too much about how much they loved each other and not much else.&#8226;Some of the love was just a little bit to schmaltzy and overdone.&#8226;I had trouble knowing whose POV I was reading and had to go back and re-read a few times.&#8226;I wish there was more of them as parents!See the full review as well as daily sales and freebies at Ana's Attic Book Blog",4.0

Outsiders and characters who aren't a part of one group or another, but come together to make their own place. Sometimes they follow the law, most of the time they skirt it...a bit. Kali is focused and gets distracted by her inventions. She's independent and isn't completely comfortable dealing with people in any way other than snark. Pair her up with a sword-wielding, gun-touting man oozing mystery and carrying a grudge, explosions, some longstanding nemeses, a dash of romance and a teensy bit of magic and you have a Buroker-themed good time. Lots of fun. I appreciate that the characters aren't overly noble. It lends a scrappy honesty to their actions. Looking forward to seeing more of Kali and Cedar!",4.0

9114,"I love a dark mystery, but the construction of the plot and the weak characters kept me from enjoying this book.Obstensibly, this is the story of a detective who is investigating a series of asphyxiation murders.  The targets are beautiful young women.  However, the decective does very little investigation.  He attends a couple of autopsies, but we don't get to see any of the sleuthing that is the usual hallmark of the genre.  If he investigates anything about the women's lives of what they have in common, readers never find out.  Instead we have a bit of &#34;Keystone Kops&#34; style detecting courtesy of a computer dating magnate and his IT man (they determine that the young women were all clients and try to determine who the killer is before the news gets out and wrecks their bottom line).  The detective spends most of his time worried about his personal life and none of his interactions seem particularly authentic.  And the way the author wraps up the plotline about his personal life left me scratching my head.Despite the fact that the author introduces us to a woman who is, presumably, a future victim of the killer, there is no real suspense or thrills here.  There are too many characters and their charactization is shoddy.  We don't care about the detective, we don't care about the dead women, we don't care about the rich man, we don't care about the coroner, we don't care about the potential victim -- every time I thought I'd run out of people to not care about, Hudson introduced another character.  The tension in their lives (cheating spouses, angry bosses, drunk drivers, etc) never comes into focus.It seems as if the investigation portion of the novel is so uneven because Hudson might not understand that much about investigation and killing, a serious issue in a serial killer procedural.  At one point, we're told by a supposed expert that the reason why the killer creates such elaborate asphyxiation scenarios for his victims is because he mistakenly believes it will heighten their sexual pleasure.  Given the amount of sexual and physical abuse the victims sustain and the fact that we're told he repeatedly revives them prior to finally letting them die, I think it is far more likely that the killer was a sadism, determined to bring his victims pain -- not pleasure.  Errors like this can be quite jarring and made me feel like I was reading an underresearched book.",2.0

I really do not mind erotica but this book made me squirm uncomfortably a few times.  The opening orgy made me sick.  I felt like Lainey-girl was a severely abused girl that needed therapy not sex.  For someone to sell themselves so cheaply was just annoying.Maybe I am just used to the straight laced virgin historical girl.  Maybe I am wrapped a little too tight.  Maybe with the knowledge I have with the MC clubs I know most girls are hands off.  Which is why one man (Enforcer)  is assigned to me whenever we were at an event. I cant even go to the bathroom alone.Some of the sex scenes were great. I was horrified when she was tied up and basically raped but loved every minute of it.  For a H to be ""in love"" with a man and so openly spread her legs like peanut butter for another kind of blew the book for me.  Did her man not think her a whore after witnessing her foursome?

9129,This reminds me of those romance movies you catch on ABC Family or Hallmark channel. It's not the best quality and it's pretty obvious how its going to play out but you keep watching because it's cute. That's pretty much how this book is. It's not at all realistic but the events and romance is very sweet and enjoyable. I wish the author had the romantic development span over the course of a week or so instead of having them pretty much fall in love and do everything over the course of a day. Their relationship was way too rushed for my tastes and all the loose ends were tied too easily. Other than that it's a nice little romantic fix just for the sake of reading a romance.,3.0

9139,"Despite the glowing reviews, I've put off reading this book because I wasn't impressed with the previous books I've read by James. Luckily, I was able to check it out from the library. It's fantastic! I require logic and linear progression of events in order to enjoy a story, and based on the two other books by James which I've read, I picture James as a free spirited, lively person who approaches writing in a joyful though haphazard way. I could be totally wrong, but that's the impression I got. Anyway, there's absolutely nothing haphazard about this book! It's lovely, and the tone and feel actually reminds me of Loretta Chase's belovedLord of Scoundrels.India's an interesting and extremely appealing heroine, along the lines of Sophy in Heyer'sThe Grand Sophy. Her career as a decorator and life organizer to the wealthiest families felt original and was presented in a very convincing manner, with her godmother Adelaide by her side as a chaperone and companion. I love that India charges exorbitant fees to make sure her services are valued and she's treated with respect - so true! Thorn is a typical alpha-male hero, though his childhood spent as a mudlark is interesting and he puts this skill to use in the climax of the story. His protective and loving relationship with Rose and memories of his younger siblings are very endearing.*** Spoiler *** I wish India and Thorn hadn't consummated their relationship prior to Thorn declaring himself. They mutually decide to have sex while Thorn declares he will not marry her and intends to marry Lala. Yuck! That is very hard for me to relate to - why would a woman give herself to a man who clearly and vocally prefers another person? Oh well, this is not an unusual plot device in Regency books, just one that I don't prefer to read. At least India didn't sit around lamenting her actions and was prepared to move on - I could admire her resolve and strength.  *** End Spoiler ***Overall outstanding book that I would read again. 4.5 stars, minus half star for what I stated in my spoiler.",5.0

As expected it is not smooth sailing and happy ever after-there is more drama and more adventure to be found.  This series could easily be considered contrived and superficial due to the extremes that are through out the book: horrific childhood, loss of family, brokenness on multiple levels, extreme wealth with what appears extreme ease, insecurity, fear, stalking and self-worth issues that would keep Freud busy for lifetimes.

Instead, Bruenor, Catt-brie, Regis, and Wulfgar were reborn into the world as newborn babies.  Unlike normal children, however, these four retained all of their memories from their past life and were fully aware of who they were the moment they opened their eyes. From this point, Mr. Salvatore did an outstanding job of weaving an intriguing tale of the first twenty-one years of Bruenor, Catt-brie, and Regis&#8217; lives as they grew to adulthood, developed new talents and slowly evolved into similar yet different people.  But no matter their new personas, each of the Companions inevitably wove their way through life and its innumerable obstacles to met again in Icewind Dale on a certain day at a certain spot when their old companion Drizzt was in desperate need of their assistance.Night of the Hunter picks up immediately after the events in The Companions. Now reunited, the Companions of the Hall must see if their former friendship has survived Bruenor, Catt-brie, Regis, and Wulfgar&#8217;s resurrection.  Naturally, there are issues. A second chance at life has changed Drizzt&#8217;s old friends in many ways.  Things that they once agreed upon so easily are now objects of contention. Internal struggles ensue, as Bruenor and Catt-brie decide that their goddess-given rebirth is an opportunity for them to rectify previous mistakes.  Mistakes that Drizzt himself still views as the proper course, and so the dark elf finds himself being forced to look long and hard at whether many of his dearly held truths about life might be wrong, and quickly, it begins to look like these old friends could split apart over what their new mission in the world should be.  Before things get too heated, however, one task is mentioned that all can agree upon: the rescue of their old friend Thibbledorf Pwent from his haunted existence as a vampire in the halls of ancient Gauntlygrim, and so our heroes head out into the world for a new adventure.  Their differences set aside for the moment &#8211; but not forgotten.From this point, the story divides off into several different plots and main characters.  Naturally, the primary story line follows Drizzt and the Companions as they travel the lands, heading for Gauntlygrim and then arriving, but substantial portions of the book are also given over to Drizzt&#8217;s former band of adventurers (headed now by Artemis Entreri and Dahlia) as well as the drow, specifically the activities of Matron Mother Baenre.  And for the remainder of the novel, Mr. Salvatore shifts perspective from one group to another, spinning an ambitious tale of reunion (The Companions), lose (Entreri/Dahlia&#8217;s group), and machination (The drow).  With all three stories going on at once, a reader is hard pressed to keep everything straight in his mind, but Mr. Salvatore has always had a knack for juggling numerous plot threads, and he does an admirable job here of having each cast of characters act independently but keep their stories intertwined just enough that they all are obviously moving toward a dramatic collision.Overall, this book was an action-packed, sword and sorcery adventure tale that mixed in enough character interaction and diabolical, drow intrigue to keep my attention.  My only criticism &#8211; minor though it will sound &#8211; is that there is so much going on in Night of the Hunter that much of the plot seemed a bit rushed, as if Mr. Salvatore could have easily added in another volume to this latest chapter in Drizzt&#8217;s story.  Other than this one issue though, I highly recommend this novel to all Drizzt fans or lovers of entertaining sword and sorcery tales, and while the promised climax of the story does not occur in Night of the Hunter, it is set up very nicely, leaving a Drizzt fan salivating for the war between drow, orcs, dwarves, and elves that is sure to follow in succeeding novels.I received this book from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I&#8217;d like to thank Netgalley and Wizards of the Coast for allowing me to receive this review copy and inform everyone that the review you have read is my opinion alone.",4.0

9170,"We think of Pompeii as frozen in the year 79 A.D., and maybe it was indeed inert until people started digging around the site in the eighteenth century.  From then on, the place has inevitably changed, as people dug in it and restored it to their way of thinking, fantasized about it, took parts of it away, and made it fit for the thousands of visitors who came to wander its streets.  It is this story that is told in _From Pompeii: The Afterlife of a Roman Town_ (Belknap/Harvard) by Ingrid D. Rowland.  The author is a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Rome, and her chapters are essays on aspects of the city.  Some of them are personal, like her memories of being taken to the area when she was a child (there is a picture here of her as an eight-year-old in Herculaneum, with a Brownie camera dangling from her neck) or her experiences in taking commercial tours from Rome to the region where she has conducted more serious academic tours.  While the chapters are chronological, Rowland is a digressive and often witty writer, who obviously enjoys relating facts in a more informal way (nonetheless, there are plenty of footnotes).  &#8220;This book presents a selection of visitors whose lives were forever altered by their experience of Pompeii, as well as a few who reacted less drastically.&#8221;  While there are plenty of references to the city, its history, and its archaeology, the story of its afterlife proves to be colorful, frustrating, and funny.Pompeii&#8217;s discovery came after Herculaneum was being dug up, and by 1765 tour guides had added Pompeii to their repertoires for people coming to see the region around Naples.  Much of Rowland&#8217;s book has to do with visits to Pompeii by famous people.  The fifteen-year-old Mozart went in 1770, and it is often said that Mozart&#8217;s visit to the site, especially the Temple of Isis, helped inspire parts of _The Magic Flute_.  But Rowland admits, &#8220;How exactly are we to recognize the reflection of an archaeological site in a musical composition?&#8221;  Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#8217;s novel _The Last Days of Pompeii_ has characters say things like, &#8220;Ho, Diomed, well met!  Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?&#8221;  The 1867 novel, which seems to insert Victorian speech and views into the doomed city, was a bestseller, and it used to be (seriously) recommended for those who were making their first visit to view the ruins.  Dickens visited in 1845, and wrote a description in _Pictures of Italy_ which movingly could describe the ruins as we see them even now.  He was moved by imagining all those Pompeians wiped out by Vesuvius, but he was disturbed by the Neapolitan cult of the dead.  Mark Twain visited in 1875, and in _Innocents Abroad_ wrote acerbically about the Neapolitan belief in the miraculous liquefaction of the blood of San Gennaro which helped draw money from onlookers (he&#8217;d chuckle to know that the blood is still performing this function).  Like Dickens, he was more moved by the ruins of Pompeii itself, and he was inspired by the figure of the &#8220;Steadfast Soldier,&#8221; a guard whose skeleton was found in his guard-box, refusing to abandon his post just because a volcano was raging.  Many other moralists at the time admired the Steadfast Soldier; there is, however, no evidence that the skeleton was any more than some unfortunate Pompeian, fleeing with all the others, who ducked under an arch, not into a guard-box, for shelter.  Pierre-Auguste Renoir visited Italy in 1881 after struggling in Paris for twenty years, and was inspired by the classical paintings he saw and by the light.  He admired the frescoes from Pompeii that he saw in the National Museum in Naples and on site.  His paintings became brighter and more sculptural because of them.  In 1994, Hillary Clinton refused to be satisfied with seeing just Herculaneum, and got into Pompeii, although her tour was abbreviated.  Secret Service agents went before her room by room to make sure everything was safe, and their protectiveness extended to preventing her from entering a room in the beautiful House of the Vettii where there is a famous statue of the god Priapus with his enormous phallus.  This was not going to be a photo op.In Rowland&#8217;s vivid telling, Pompeii proves to be a very lively place indeed.  And still the ancient streets are alive with guides and tourists.  Buying and selling and arguing go on nearby, just as they did two thousand years ago.  The other constant is Mount Vesuvius, which is now overdue for an eruption, and it is quite possible that the whole place will be buried again, along with much of the the surrounding area along the Bay of Naples.  The Neapolitans are skeptical about government, and there is every reason to believe that any evacuation plan, even with scientific warnings the ancient Pompeians never had, is going to leave thousands behind when the volcano blows.  &#8220;There is simply no way to escape the discrepancy of scale between Vesuvius and human beings,&#8221; writes Rowland.  &#8220;It is one of the reasons that Pompeii pulls so on our imagination.&#8221;",5.0

9172,"I have read all four of Dirk Hayhurst's books now and have enjoyed each one of them. Where the first three predominately focused on the lighter side of baseball (with terrific background into his troubled family, his supportive romance and subsequent marriage), &#34;Bigger Than the Game&#34; takes a slightly different tack. Dirk gets injured and his experiences move to the trials and tribulations of dealing with rehab, teammates resentful of his writing, and the realization that what makes one good on the field of competition is not necessarily what gives one an acceptable quality of life.Dirk Hayhurst's writing is vulnerable and real. We are privy to the rarely seen shadow world of pro sports rehabbing and psychologists. A particularly funny section of the book takes place at the world famous Andrews Clinic in Birmingham, where Hayhurst encounters sadistic trainers, a baseball crazy nun, a living ghost of the old south, and wrestler Triple H.The world of the injured player can be a difficult one. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think being lonely has anything to do with the number of people you&#8217;re around,&#8221; writes Hayhurst. Largely separated from the team during their physical rehab regimen, players are suddenly removed from the game they have devoted their lives to from an early age. With time suddenly on their hands basic insecurities often rise and introspection follows. Some cannot handle it. Some become depressed and turn to pain meds, some turn to alcohol, and some face difficult home lives. &#8220;Spring training for the injured is like detention. While everyone else is out having fun, sharing experiences in the game they love, you&#8217;re stuck inside doing tedious busywork.&#8221; While teams now often provide a sports psychologist to help players work through these problems, actually going to see one is seen as a sign of weakness by many in the game.Hayhurst finally does go to the psychologist, albeit reluctantly, and works to come to terms with his difficulties. Professional sports is a business, and as a business it is performance based. &#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;This whole industry is morally bankrupt. It&#8217;s full of fakes and bastards and arrogant SOBs who can get away with murder as long as they play great. And then, on the flip side, there&#8217;s a pocket of decent guys who deserve respect, but don&#8217;t get it if they don&#8217;t play well&#8230;but instead of trying to say we&#8217;re not a commodity, we just want to be the most valuable commodity possible&#8230;both sides say they hate it and yet both sides wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.&#8221; Later, when he talks to wrestler Triple H at the Andrews Clinic, Hayhurst realizes that playing a sport professionally is &#8220;a job where people look at the role you play on television and feel they have the right to make up what your life should be like.&#8221;If, as Yogi Berra said, 90 percent of baseball is half mental, the mental side of the game is much underrepresented in print. Players have to learn not only how to play the game, but how to play a role when they reach the elite levels of their sport. Many struggle off the field with this distinction, with disastrous results plucked right from today's headlines. Hayhurst encounters all of these issues and more. Instead of succumbing to his problems, he uses the time to step away from the intense competition of sport and get some much-needed perspective. &#8220;&#8230;at the end of the day, we were just grown men putting on costumes and playing children&#8217;s games. To take any of it more seriously than that was a mistake.&#8221; The money, competition, intensity and constant press coverage seems to warp perspectives and values in sports in a way that makes people glorify the game and forget that there are other things that are more important. Players coddled from a young age because of their athletic abilities often forget that there is much more out there that is bigger than the game.Dirk Hayhurst gives us a rare and fascinating behind the scenes glimpse of broken athletes working out of the spotlight not just to return to form, but to discover and face what it really is to be human. &#8220;You know,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I think I learned more about baseball this year than any season before it, and I didn't throw a single pitch.&#8221;",5.0

9210,"I just finished reading this, ( December 29th) and I have to say... READ IT!!  Rie reminds me of early Ward with every turn of the page.  While this is a M/M love story - its just THAT - one of the best love stories I've ever read.  The world she's designed is creative, unique, intriguing and suspenseful!  I'm an Utopian kinda girl, so wasn't sure I could &#34;do&#34; M/M dystopian future - but my heart was pulled straight into this story - and the story is fantastic! I haven't cried from reading a book in a long time - but I cried 2 or 3 times in this story, and its not pointless angst, just to rip your heart out, its LOVE - its fighting for everything you want despite impossible odds, its impossible love and what that journey would be like for those not willing to ever give up!Some of you read so much erotic romance - its starting to get a bit stale...you know what I mean, you're looking for something FRESH.  Reading this M/M love story serves up a different flavor, different flare of romance, whats arousing and erotic to men - real men!  Not trashy, or pornographic at all in my opinion. You will be so pleasantly surprised - and so hotly anxious to read more of her work!  This is a serious attention grabbing debut book from a very talented, funny, beautiful, down to earth, southern girl. I look forward to so much more from RIE, and you should too!  You won't be able to stop yourself from loving Commander Casper Cannon - &#34;Hunky Big Man&#34;  or the beautiful free-spirited &#34;Blondie&#34;  Nathaniel Rice.  But as usual,  all the really good ones are either Gay or Taken!  Prepare to lose your heart to this story and its author.",5.0

Those crazy stunts you pulled or the stupid pictures of yourself getting a tidbit drunk or going crazy at a party may come back to haunt you.People don't think to look on the Internet much to find out what others are saying about them.

I really didn't know what the book was about but it was looking forward to getting my hands on it. I was not disappointed when I was gifted a copy from Arden Aoide ( HUGE thanks to you lady I want MORE now!!) Every Girl dreams of her wedding and wants to look her best, not Shula she wanted to show everyone how much she didn't want this wedding. See arranged marriages would be hard for anyone but knowing that your mother killed herself to save you from this arranged marriage really makes you not want it. Shula goes the extreme to show it why should she care, she plans on killing herself. But then at the wedding something happens and it makes the arranged marriage more tolerable. I am sucked into this world, it had to beginning of love, resent, plotting and murder it in. I can't wait to see whats next and what it was Shula's mother knew. I just know there's a lot of this story that had to deal with what she knew and why she killed herself. I believe fans of Arden's fans will not be disappointed in A Consummation. But I believe this will bring her more fans, and I am very excited to see where this series will take her.I was very lucky to be gifted with a copy for this review.

On example:  a character is accused of a shooting murder, but apparently no one things to check her for gun shot residue, which might have provided very important evidence.  Another &#34;lack&#34;' that troubled me was that the cops responsible for investigating each of two different crimes seemed not to be investigating at all, just choosing a convenient suspect (I know, that is probably true-to-life, but still...).

9233,"I've decided to add the merchant marine to the list of industries where I'd rather not work.  Shipping stuff by sea has become incredibly cheap, and the quality of life on board container ships has suffered as their owners have looked to cut costs as much as possible.This is combined with the unethical but totally legal practice of choosing your own country of origin (with most companies choosing the ones with the least cost and/or oversight), which leaves the crew at the mercy of uncaring legal systems when they're stiffed by their employers.Turnaround times while in port have shortened to less than a day, meaning that shore leave is short when the crew gets any at all.  Maersk (and other companies) forbids families (due to piracy), drinking (for obvious reasons), and plenty of other things that would make a seafaring life less monotonous.I knew most of this before reading the book, but I was happy to see it fleshed out.If I enjoyed the book, why'd I give it three stars?  The content felt padded out.  The journey itself could have been a long article.  The piracy chapter was way too long, as were some of the other non-narrative portions of the book.

However, The One and Only is just awful. First, I understand that football is a character in the book but I feel she relies on it too much in lieu of developing her characters on a deeper level. I got bogged down by the endless amount of football statistics and discussion. The characters just didn't grab me and I found them difficult to relate with. Second, I was really hoping Shea wasn't going to develop a romantic relationship with the coach but it went there. If it weren't for the fact that they were like &#34;family&#34; and he was a father figure to her and messages of that nature were heavily emphasized early on, it would not have been bothersome. But the whole thing just felt very inscestual and VERY, VERY creepy. The main character has deep psychological issues regarding her relationships with men.

9246,"Crash Gordon and the Revelations from Big Sur certainly has a wide array of colorful characters if nothing else. I think every kind is hit here. Derek did a great job of mixing the many personalities into the story and they all have their own distinct voice. Not only that but the work in of some of life's conspiracies and a mix of explanations/theories, really propels the story from start to finish.The first person narrative was an interesting change of pace from most novels I've read of late. It does let the reader get a sense of the inner workings throughout but the perspectives shift at times such as in the prologue, which can get a bit confusing unless you are really paying attention. Also well I liked the little added cliff notes in parentheses&#8202;, I'm not sure they were needed every time.The descriptors are surely top notch and not much is held back, so if you can get offended by language or images that will surely pop in your head, it may not be for you.But other than that it was clear there was a plan from the very beginning. You won't be left out in the cold with a lackluster ending, which so many books fail on. Crash Gordon and the Revelations from Big Sur provides a satisfying ending, that makes the trip there all the more enjoyable.With sex cults, alien abductions, and even a foul mouthed radio DJ, there is something here for everyone. The images throughout are also a nice touch.",5.0

9248,"Children are our most precious responsibility and yet as a stay at home mom, I was amazed how many people tried to pawn their children off on me every chance they got.  I was considered a &#34;good mom&#34; and we had a &#34;good family&#34;.  We were white, middle class professional background and people never looked beyond what they saw.  I came from a not so safe background and I always thought to myself, &#34;How do these people know I'm not an axe murderer.&#34;  This book deals with not only the kidnapping and theft by a con artist met through Facebook, but the falling apart of a marriage through hubris and failed expectations.Lately I seem to be reading a lot of stories that center around men who allow their vanities free will by entering into elaborate fantasy flirtations to outright affairs instead of being honest and trying to fix what is wrong with their relationships.  Tommy is an English, Oxford educated computer programmer married to a naive well off Princess named Sylvia.  She is four years older than Tommy who came from a lower class background.  Tommy hits a mid-life crisis early and they decide to move to Wyoming and sell their New York apartment to raise their adopted daughter Grace in a better place.  They do not visit the place in winter and they find they sunk all their money into a pit they can't sell.  They need help from her father and their marriage starts to slide.  Tommy starts flirting with a 20 year old wanna be actress/model.  He constantly Facebooks her which is making his wife despair.  Her Dad dies and Tommy is in LA for a job interview for a job that won't pay for a good life in LA.  He has another lunch plus we don't actually know with the little user he is in fantasy with and is not able to be reached when his wife calls him.  Her father has overdosed on his sleeping pills and she needs to leave to try to reach him before he dies.  There is only one seat on one flight available to get her there.  Ruth, her writer Facebook friend, is there to visit Sylvia and she and Tommy convince her to go.  Tommy gets a ticket for talking and driving on a cell phone and misses his flight back and when he arrives a day later, Ruth has stolen his daughter and his wife's inheritance.  She dyed her hair and took Grace and disappeared after she stole the money.Tommy had lied that he had a job in LA that would make a lot of money in a short time and coincidentally met the 20 year old shortly after landing.  Tommy takes off to try to find Grace leaving Sylvia to talk to the FBI and post films of Grace on You Tube and using Lonely Planet to try to find Ruth in the wilds of Central America and South America.  He once again shuts Sylvia out of the process making her feel useless.  He finds Ruth in the Copacabana where she was staying with his wife's money recovering from plastic surgery.  She steals his iPhone after feeling him up and gets out without paying leaving the iPhone and a cheery note for Sylvia.I am parsing the book at this point so I will see how it ends.  It has moments of lyricism if you can work your way through the plot and the unbelievable characters.  I love Grace, but I am having a hard time caring about anybody other that Jacqueline, the maid who helped bring Sylvia up and provides guidance and comfort.This book just does not work for me despite the good reviews that are not posted by verified buyers.  The idea of having your child stolen is a frightening one that would have worked better if the main characters had not acted so stupidly.  They need to grow up and the idea of living in an area with a small child where you do not know someone local well enough to leave your child with in an emergency is not a logical one.  Anyone who left their child with someone they met over the internet is seriously damaged.  A more believable plot device would have made the immaturity of the three main characters less glaring.",3.0

There is a slight chance that people might look at you funny when they see you crying your eyes out ;-)I fell in love with this wonderful trio; Lynsie and Lincoln, the perfect married couple, and Dax, their best friend, whom they can always count on.  When tragedy strikes and Lynsie finds her world in shambles, Dax steps in to help her pick up the pieces.  It is so heartbreaking to live through the pain right along with her, but also very heartwarming to see her growth and healing.  The relationship that blossoms from this tragedy is so amazing and you get to experience the confusion and butterflies that the characters are feeling.The story is so well written and the character development goes at just the perfect pace.To say that I loved this story and these characters is an understatement.Broken Wings is a book that should be in everyone's hands.",5.0

9265,"This is not a perfect book, but it flows into the world of Kate Daniels so well and has a couple twists I didn't see coming. I am a little torn over the obligatory fight Kate and Curran have near the end of the book (well, the frustrated falling-out that they have through the second half of the book that culminates in a real I'm-leaving-you-the-hell-you-are kind of fight). On the one hand, do they have to have essentially the same misunderstanding/doubting our love-fest every book? On the other, Curran did act like a patronizing ass. I think Kate let him off too easy for that, however, given that he does sort of redeem himself and they do work so well together, I guess I can make do.The best part of this book was all the character development going on. No one does characters like Ilona Andrews; even her secondary characters are all well fleshed out and fascinating in their strengths and weaknesses.  Doolittle's ferocity and fear, for example, was great to see. The little side drama of Aunt B, Andrea, and Raphael was heartbreaking and completely understandable. Even the obnoxious pregnant woman who could so easily have been nothing more than a plot device ended up being kind of a cool character.",5.0

9269,"Harriet Burden, the protagonist of this novel, frustrated by the inability of a female artist to gain the exposure or respect accorded to men, collaborates in turn with three male artists willing to exhibit her work as theirs. Although there are common themes in all three exhibits, their styles are radically different, changing with each mask that Burden puts on. I found this interesting, since the three books by Siri Hustvedt that I have read (WHAT I LOVED,THE SUMMER WITHOUT MEN, and this), while also sharing similar themes, are so different in texture and approach as to present quite different facets of their author. WHAT I LOVED inhabits the art world as brilliantly as this new book does, but it is full of characters that you care about as human beings, and is built around a linear story that keeps you reading. THE SUMMER WITHOUT MEN, the weakest of these three books, is basically a justified feminist lament centered around a character who is difficult to like, and told more or less in scrapbook form, though with flashes of real brilliance.And this one? First of all, it is as tightly engineered intellectually as a BMW. Although it continues some of the scrapbook approach of SUMMER, being a collection of statements, cuttings, and journal entries illuminating the last decade of Burden's career, it has none of the random feel of its predecessor. The ""Editor's Introduction"" immediately introduces an atmosphere of scholarly rigor, footnoted with references to writers, artists, and thinkers who, whether famous or obscure, all seem to be real. Harriet Burden's range of knowledge (and therefore by rather too obvious implication that of her creator) is phenomenal. A very small selection of the names referenced in her book might include: Margaret Cavendish, Edmund Husserl, Sren Kierkegaard, Tertullian, and Aby Warburg. These are just some of the names I happen to recognize, but the list of those I don't is inexhaustible: Gallese, Gassendi, Manturana, Metzinger, Varela, Zahavi.... Every reference that I followed up turns out to be the genuine article, so I assume they all are, but I do get the feeling that part of Hustvedt's reason for writing is to display everything she knows, and wow it's a lot! I was blown away... but not drawn in.About art, Hustvedt writes well, as she always has. It is interesting that when artists are mentioned in modern fiction, they are almost always conceptual artists or the makers of installations -- probably because such art is much easier to convey in words. The last major novels I recall whose protagonists are actual painters areMY NAME IS ASHER LEVby Chaim Potok andTHE UNDERPAINTERby Jane Urquhart. But inA MAP OF GLASS, Urquhart turned to sculptors and environmental artists. Bill Wechsler, the leading artist in Hustvedt's WHAT I LOVED (also referenced here) begins as a painter, but turns to constructions. And both artists in Claire Messud's recentTHE WOMAN UPSTAIRS-- a novel with remarkable similarities to this one, and I think the more successful of the two -- are engaged in making environments that develop feminist themes.As does Harriet Burden: everything ranging from doll-houses through soft sculptures to room-filling labyrinths. Her first ""mask"" collaboration is a piece called ""The History of Western Art,"" in which a huge sculpture based on a Titian nude is pasted all over with witty references to women over the past 600 years of art. Her second, ""Suffocation Rooms,"" is a series of kitchens where the furniture gradually gets larger and the temperature hotter. Her third, ""Beneath,"" a collaboration with a neo-Warhol media star known only as Rune, is an oblique response to 9/11, in which the viewer penetrates a maze of distorted passages pierced with windows and peepholes giving onto disturbing sights. If there is a conventional plot in the novel at all, it is the mystery of why the collaboration with Rune went so very wrong, and possibly contributed to the death of both artists. [All the above, incidentally, are facts that we learn from the introduction.]When I started this review, I was sure I was going to give the book a five-star rating, if only for its intellectual density and the fascination of its multi-voiced approach. But as I write, I realize that while these things can intrigue or amuse me, they do not make me care about the people. I miss the plot of WHAT I LOVED, and Oh how I miss the characters! After reading 360 pages by and about Harriet Burden, I still don't feel I know her. I sympathize with her plight, yes -- most of what Hustvedt says about women's issues is spot on -- but that is very different from caring about her as a person. And while there is much of interest in the story of the failings of Harriet's parents and her late husband (a wealthy art dealer), or perhaps her own as a mother, there is simply too much there -- together with musings on sexuality and a dozen other topics. I just feel that on the emotional and thematic planes Hustvedt is trying to repeat what she does in the intellectual sphere -- cramming in a lot of everything, but leaving little for the reader to embrace. So those five stars for effort must alas be rounded down.",4.0

9275,"Paranormal is not usually my thing, so I was pleasantly surprised by how wrapped up in this book I became.  I was intrigued by Addie (and loved how she came by that name) and the mystery surrounding what happened to her and to the Alchemica Academy.  Addie was a strong and confident character while still suffering from amnesia over the events of that night when the Academy blew up.  A few of the character interactions were a little off, and I was confused by what some of the magical characters were all about (but I attribute that to my own lack of paranormal reading experience), but overall I found the story engaging enough to keep me up waaay past my bedtime.  And now I've already purchased book two and am looking forward to reading it.An interesting storyline and characters and the fact that it spurred me on enough to purchase book two give four stars to this novel.",4.0

9284,"Full review at ontopdownunderbookreviews.comThis book is not a gay romance. It is a powerful piece of LGBT fiction that happens to have a gay man as the narrator, and that gay man happens to have a partner. But the book is about so much more. The Shattered Door is about being beaten down psychologically, trying to be a good person, trying to believe in yourself, despite adversity, and maintain a relationship with God. It is about creating another family and not allowing someone who the MC was taught to love honour and obey from birth, no matter what, to have so much power. Our parents are deified by us, by the Ten Commandments, and by society. It is hard to break the need, the instruction to be a good child worthy of love, no matter our age, when it is impossible to do that with the parent(s) you have been given. That process is a complex one and Brandon Witt nailed it. It is also very much about religion and being a gay man trying to find himself, maintain his faith, when many have told him that it is a sin and an abomination. Others have linked being gay to being a paedophile. That he will 'go to Hell' has been preached at him for years, on top of a mother who backs it up in her own toxic way.If you are open to good writing, some parts that make you want to unleash your anger, that make you (want to) cry, that make you think, and make you glad that you did not grow up with Rose Morrison as your mother. If you want to read a book that brands you, then read the wonderful, painful, hopeful and heartfelt The Shattered Door.&#8220;You&#8217;ll be fine.  Assuming the church don&#8217;t catch fire or nothin&#8217; when you walk in with your blaze of gayness, that is.&#8221;&#8220;Maudra! Shhh!&#8221;  That was all I needed.

The gold leaf is so thin that it falls apart and clings to everything. My son had it stuck to his hands and on his clothes.

Lytton Driving Hawk grew up on an Indian Reservation and graduated with a PhD.

Fate has now bought June and Lytton  together.Faux Paus, a member of the MC says &#34; I see a lot of Ford in Lytton. They are both intense, powerful, mentally sharp men. It's a though if they focus the power of their mind into one sharp beam, it could cut like a knife. I see similarities that they probably don't even see because they're too close to it. I knew they were brothers before the DNA results even came back. They may have grown up separately, but their hearts are one, together. See how they chose two beautiful sisters.&#34; That said it all describing these two alpha men!!!!

9306,"Six Suspects clearly shows the ability of the author in writing powerful scenes. But the structure of the book got in its way. It took almost four hundred pages to weave back to the point of the book and in the meantime it was a little confusing to remember the individual characters and how each of them fit into the whole. There were a little too many cliches for my liking and I was quite disappointed when my favorite character was murdered at the end ruining any hope that the one with the most integrity would triumph. I had to push my way through the last 75 pages -- get on with it already. This is not a defeat for the writer because each section was well-written except for some cliches that distracted me, but the problem with this book is the connection to its conclusion. So the writer's ability kept me reading but the story itself was sometimes a push. I'd still encourage people to read Six Suspects and decide for themselves.Jan Marquart Author and CEO and Founder of About the Author Network",3.0

I was looking forward to Trent's story because he is one of my favorite characters in the series. However, this whole book seemed like it was pulled together all too quickly. It didn't really flow, Cami's brothers were super aggressive and then it was like they dropped off the face of the earth. Her family issues were NEVER resolved. The ending was insanely rushed and all in all really not well written out. First of all, why in the world would TJ date Cami knowing Trenton loved her forever? Then when it finally came out who TJ was it was like nothing ever happened, BAM! everyone was happy and moved on. It honestly makes no sense. The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the short glimpses we got of Abby and Travis. I really hope Thomas's story isn't like this one :/ I really loved the BD series.",3.0

9313,"Max and her &#8220;flock&#8221; are no normal group of kids. Far from it. They&#8217;ve been chased by various evil geniuses their whole lives, escaped from high security prisons, regained some sense of their identities and even found a place they could call home. If only those chasing them would stop, allowing them a well-deserved breather from continual pursuit.These aren&#8217;t just normal kids, though. These kids are what you&#8217;d call special. And I&#8217;m not talking about special in an oh-they-are-so-cute-and-adorable-and-well-behaved kind of way. This is a different kind of special. A superhero kind of special. Like having wings, and super sharp vision, gills for underwater excursions, and being able to disappear right in front of people, as well as having the ability to go all Jedi mind-tricky and manipulate any living being&#8217;s thoughts. And not to mention their extraordinary um&#8230;shall we say&#8230;fragrance. Not exactly abilities you&#8217;d expect for a normal, run-of-the-mill teenager. (Well, except for the extraordinary fragrance part.)And did I mention there&#8217;s also a talking, flying dog tagging along with the flock? Oh yeah&#8212;there&#8217;s one.Most people have normal days. They wake up, go to work or school, come home, relax, before heading off to bed so they can do it all again the next day. Not Max.Max&#8217;s normal day is like the nightmare of all nightmare days. A day of dread, filled with getting attacked by evil flesh-covered robot ninjas looking to go all martial artsy on your noggin, avoiding becoming a hot lunch for a monstrous sea creature, being kidnapped and threatened, chasing bad guys across an ocean to save a loved one, and trying to hold your family together, while remaining bullet hole free. It&#8217;s a tough gig. Try having that be your normal day.James Patterson does a stellar job of furthering the story of Max and her flock in the latest installment of the Maximum Ride series, Max. The novel delves deeper into each character&#8217;s background and personality, as well as into their awesome superpowers! Each character is expanded upon in the book, making the story even more addicting and engaging. The true highlight, though, is how Patterson finally throws Max headfirst into a romantic relationship, filled with oodles of delicious teenage bird-kid awkwardness. He does an incredible job of making Max and her efforts for love relatable to the reader. It&#8217;s great to finally see her have something all her own in her life. Something personal.Not only is the character development exemplary, but as always in a Maximum Ride novel, the action was non-stop, in-your-face, wow-I-haven&#8217;t-had-time-to-catch-my-breath intense. Written for a teens and tweens audience (but enjoyable for ANY age), the plot line is fast-paced, edge of your seat entertainment. The story never drags, never slows, rabbit-ing along to its stunning conclusion. Patterson writes the story from Max&#8217;s point-of-view, offering a fresh perspective, which lends itself to some very amusing one-liners that are interspersed perfectly between intense, nail-biting moments. It&#8217;s comic relief&#8212;Max style. And it&#8217;s awesome. There&#8217;s no way someone couldn&#8217;t fall in love with Max and her &#8220;flock.&#8221;Once again James Patterson has created an entertaining, lightning-fast paced story that I just could&#8217;t get enough of. Like literary apple pie. With two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. The only disappointment in the whole book: that there wasn&#8217;t even more to read! Max as well as the rest of the Maximum Ride series is wonderful for almost any age group and always rises to the occasion, each new installment seemingly better than the previous book. Once again Max rocks!",5.0

9321,"It took me a while but I eventually found that I liked this book.  My wife thought it was a weird story and couldn't get past the training regimen that occurred throughout the story with Ender and the other kids.  I thought the ages of the kids was hard to get past until you started to see them as genius-level soldiers and especially with Ender, a level of maturity not usually seen in adults.  I was reminded of the training programs that the female gymnasts go through to prepare for the Olympics.  Most of them are young teens with exceptional athletic talents.  When you see how merciless the coaches are and how dedicated the athletes become you get a sense of what Ender faces.  Except that it's the survival of the human race that is at stake here not just a gold medal.  It was interesting to see how this story played out.  Since the reader had a little more information than Ender, you could anticipate some of the things that were going to happen to him throughout his training, at least until the end.  The climax of the story actually seemed kind of stale because Ender didn't seem to care by then what happens.  I know that this was only intended to be a 1st of four books, so you couldn't have a big ending because the story must go on.  I think that anyone who has had to go through intensive training for the military or for athletics can relate to this story.  It isn't exactly suspenseful or vividly descriptive science fiction but the story builds and the characters grow.  I liked it enough to decide to read the sequels so I would recommend this book too.",4.0

Add to that action, vampires, a feisty archeologist female protagonist (different!) and you&#8217;ve got me hooked. I really enjoyed the book and the thing that stuck in my mind most was the dogged focus of Reese, the cop, in his quest to get his man. This drives much of the plot and leads him into scrapes, adventure, romance and ultimately real danger. He will not give up, he is unstoppable and while at times has you&#8217;re tearing your hair out, you also want him to get the bad guys! It&#8217;s a major obsession and he&#8217;s not the only one with such an obsession in this book. Certainly kept me hooked to the end.",4.0

9332,"Review for The Warlord Wants Forever by Kresley ColeThe Warlord Wants Forever was my first taste of Kresley Cole&#8217;s writing style and I have to say it was pretty awesome. I was fairly disappointed when I got to the end of this novella. I am not judging it based on the length - more expressing my sadness that it ended. The characters are well developed and the way Cole describes not only the personality traits, but also the physiological traits of her creatures I felt as though they could be real. That is a hard thing to do in the world of paranormal. I can see why people rave about her series.In this book we have Myst, a Valkyrie. Valkyrie is a special kind of Lore, one that is basically considered the most kick bum and you really don&#8217;t want to mess with them. Myst is known as The Coveted One, she lures men to chase her, attack her, and she reveals in their hunt. One thing that is known among all of the Lore, Valkyrie don&#8217;t give their hearts.Nikolai Wroth is a Warlord, known for his cunning and ingenuity when it comes to battle; he is also a vampire. Unblooded vampire to be exact. I was really intrigued by the ingenuity that Cole put into her version of Vampire. When a vampire finds his mate and takes their blood into them their heart beats again, their lungs breathe once more, and they are able to sustain an erection. Prior to this blooding they are left in a living dead type state where they are unable to *ahem* smut things up.&#8232;There is a little bit of a downside to this blooding, if a vampire is blooded and doesn&#8217;t mate with his bride&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say he gets no satisfaction and pretty much lives with a perpetual hard-on and blue balls of epic proportions. I&#8217;m sure you get that Myst is Nikolai&#8217;s bride&#8230; the story takes place five years after she bloods him and leaves him in wanting. After five agonizing years he finally finds her again and well&#8230; you&#8217;ll have to read the book to find out how they get along&#8230; or don&#8217;t.I give this one 4 stars for ingenious storytelling and as for the smut level it&#8217;s a definite 4 drenched panties&#8230; for an overall FOUR star read! I look forward to reading the rest of the series and kick myself for waiting so long!Review by the Head Whore at Mommy&#8217;s a Book Whore.",4.0

The Leary series is usually full of Military Science Fiction Space action, but less so in this chapter of the series. It was still a very enjoyable story with more diplomatic style action than normal with any David Drake novel. It still develops in more depth the characters of Leary and Mundy. The fact that Cinnabar and the Alliance are at peace makes the story more of a Cold War style spy adventure story. There were still plenty of small combat action scenes both in space and on the ground to spice up the story. Good change of pace in the Leary series. Great Read!",5.0

9347,"This is my fourth Graham Saga book and I'm just as excited with this time travel tale this many books in as I was with the first one that I read. I still haven't found time to read the very first book in the series but salient facts from past books are always seamlessly woven in so a new reader never feels lost. This fifth installment continues the lives of Alex and Matthew as they make their mark in the New World having left Matthew's beloved Scotland in fear of his life because of his religious convictions.This book seems more family focused with relationships beginning and ending, births, deaths and injuries filling the pages from beginning to end. The family is just trying to live in peace but it just doesn't seem to be their lot. Young Jacob leaves to see the world and all is not joy and happiness with everyone at the homestead. To write much more would spoil plot points.  The evil Burley brothers are stalking Matthew with the intent of killing him and this particular plot development is one that about drove me crazy. They were everywhere the Grahams were. In the 17th century world they always knew where they would be at the exact time? A little too convenient and it got a little comical where it most certainly wasn't meant to be.  I realize a book needs tension but their appearances were getting to be almost rote.Despite the Burley brothers I really did enjoy the book and I thoroughly enjoy these characters and the world in which they live. It's well developed whether it's taking place in London or the New World. You feel you are in the world with the characters as the writing transports you into their lives. I can't wait for the next installment so I can continue to follow the love story of Alex and Matthew Graham.*I received a free copy for my honest review",4.0

9356,"I read this book with the 12 Books Group in June 2014.This book is full of simple and clear insights that work together to help anyone create a &#34;leader/leader&#34; culture. The author tells the story of his own experience as a captain in the US Navy and uses his experience to illustrate how to transform an organization that is used to top down command type leadership into one he describes as &#34;Leader/Leader&#34; in which each individual is truly empowered and proactive.I especially like the way the book is laid out into chapters will clear summaries at the end of each chapter with a review of the principle and how to put it into action.My favorite quote from the book, &#34;Move Authority to Where the Information Is.&#34;A few of the other golden nuggets I gleaned:The true ability of leadership is only measured and known after the leader leaves the organization. It is his &#34;clock-builder&#34; skills and not time-keeping skills that prove the test of time. This puts a greater emphasis on moving authority down the ladder.In order for the leader/leader model to work you must have competence and clarity. Competence requires a lot of training and finding the right people. Clarity requires making sure that everyone in the organization understand the WHY and has clear communication and expectations.Read this book and you will learn and improve!",5.0

9360,"You probably don't know Carol Leifer by name but chances are you've seen her work. She has been a stand-up comedienne since the 70s; she wrote for Seinfeld and the Larry Sanders show. She also has written for a few Oscar telecasts, performed with Frank Sinatra and even had her own sitcom on the old WB network. Her writing work today can be found on popular series like Modern Family and Devious Maids.How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying (great title by the way) is a book for aspiring stand-up comics, or others pursuing glamorous and creative careers. It is also part memoir, and Leifer revisits her early days in the stand up scene with one-time boyfriend Paul Reiser, Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. A lot of the book, though, comes across as a job hunting guide for people who are extremely stupid. Sample tips: Don't be late for a job interview. Have good hygiene on the job. Don't wear sexy clothes. You don't say, Carol! I would never have figured that out.Throughout the memoir/job guide Leifer takes a know-it-all approach which is less than appealing. It's admirable that she worked so hard in the industry, and a lot of her stories illustrate that hard work, but she also does not mention that she got lucky too, knowing people like Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld, and how that may have furthered her career. It is also strange to read a job guide from someone in the stand-up business. Stand-up is such unconventional work and it's not like there's a clear path to stardom, a clear guide of how to get there. It mostly amounts to talent and luck and neither of those things can be taught (well, maybe talent can, but only a little). Leifer also believes her tips can help anyone in any industry and that is definitely not true.I also didn't care for the way she addressed the women-in-comedy conumdrum. She thinks she was lucky to be a woman in stand-up in the 70s,  when it was acknowledged it was a boys club. She doesn't take men to task for holding women back in comedy, and thinks women are just complaining too much and not working hard enough to change the system.That being said, this is an amusing book, and it's fun to hear backstage gossip--spoiler alert: Diana Ross and Lorne Michaels come off like total douches--but I would have much rather gotten an honest memoir from Carol about her life in comedy. She also mentions her partner briefly but never talks about what it was like to discover she was gay mid-life.If you are looking for a really good book on being a woman in stand up comedy, I highly recommend We Killed by Yael Cohen. It gives a very broad, balanced perspective on this same subject.",3.0

There are scenes that are harrowing, but they make you appreciate all the more the hardships and sacrifices our soldiers (and the civilians) made.

9369,"This well-written, short book purports to be a contribution to a theory of value.  Scheffler asks us to imagine as a thought-experiment two grim scenarios and then asks us to think about how these possibilities would affect the way we think about what we value or, as he says more often, &#34;what matters to us.&#34;  The two scenarios involve a world without a human future, the &#34;afterlife&#34; of the title being the continued life of the human race (a communal afterlife) and not the &#34;personal afterlife&#34; that some religious traditions offer.  Scheffler is not interested in the latter possibility.  The two scenarios are &#34;The doomsday scenario&#34; --&#34;Suppose you knew that, although you yourself would live a normal life span, the earth would be completely destroyed thirty days after your death in a collision with a giant asteroid&#34; (18) -- and &#34;the infertility scenario&#34; -- everyone alive now would live out his or her normal life span, but in a world where no children are being born to create a future generation and future generations beyond that.Dire, eh?  We would feel bad, of course, and we would perhaps ask ourselves about whether what we have up to that point been doing with our lives is worth continuing with.  And there can be no doubt that there would be changes in our ways of thinking about whether or not this or that project was worthwhile.  We would have to acknowledge that our sense of what matters to us often does unthinkingly take for granted not just the lives of our own children and grandchildren but generations of people we will never know.  As Scheffler says, &#34;our confidence that there will be an afterlife is a condition of many other things mattering to us here and now&#34; (32).  One can agree with this, broadly . . . but is belief in an afterlife a NECESSARY condition of things mattering here and now?Scheffler's strongest claim is that such a belief is indeed a necessary condition of our valuing.  Here's how he frames that strong claim: &#34;We need humanity to have a future for the very idea that things matter to retain a secure place in our conceptual repertoire&#34; (60).  I read this as meaning that we could not possibly provide good reasons for our valuing ANYTHING without a belief in a communal afterlife.  Notice that we might still prefer some things or courses of action to others; we might like some things better than others -- but we could not possibly give good reasons for our judgments of value, absent an afterlife in Scheffler's sense. (&#34;I just like X or Y or Z&#34; not being a good reason, or indeed a reason at all.)The rest of the book seems to be a clarification of what that claim entails -- about temporality in relation to value, for example -- rather than an argument in support of the claim.  The claim in its strongest form (p. 60) remains, I think, just a claim, provocative to be sure, because the relations of our values to time are worth thinking about, even without the dire contexts of the doomsday and infertility scenarios.  It seems to me that what Scheffler is also wanting to get at is the idea that his thought experiments show that our values are not at bottom egoistical or individualistic.  The very act of valuing, he would like us to believe, is finally a commitment to a communal rather than a purely selfish end.  This amounts to an extension of the strong claim, and it is worth pondering, but it doesn't GROUND the claim, which, as I said, remains asserted and elaborated rather than argued.In the group with which I read and discussed the book, there was discussion of reasons why we might continue valuing (keeping the notion of value in our conceptual repertoire), one of which started from the Aristotelian distinction between process (kinesis) and activity (energeia), the former being goal-oriented and the latter being a matter of &#34;valuing in the act of doing.&#34; (My thanks to my friend Jim Edwards for the distinction).  Certain very long-term goal-oriented projects might come to seem less valuable.  But would our sense of the value of artistic appreciation or musical performance be diminished?  Might the value of such activities not be heightened?  You get the idea . . .? Lots of food for thought here, and the book includes not just Scheffler's three essays but some responses from philosophers and Scheffler's response to them.  Recommended.",4.0

9372,"Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comExperimentation, missing wolves and half breeds with strange scents, how do these all tie together? Zeke doesn't know, but he's going to figure it out.Zeke is an alpha of his pack. His pack is half-breed friendly. They don't tolerate Mary's pack and slaughter them all except two of the females. Mary is one of the two remaining. Mary bargains to save another young female wolf with her body. Zeke willingly takes Mary as his sex toy for the next month.The blurb of this story is darker than the actual story. This is a sweet fast-paced story of soul mates finding each other. Mary's transformation to a werewolf reminds me of Elena from Kelley Armstrong's Women of Otherworld. The experimentation on shifters reminds me of one of Patricia Briggs' Mercy arc. The world building in this is leveraging a lot on other existing werewolf mythologies so it's easy to follow and understand. The conflict in the story is also pretty easy to figure out and predict how it will resolve.The characters in this story are fun. They aren't too complicated but they do become endearing. Zeke is a sweet tough guy. Mary is a woman coming into her beast. The chemistry between the two is good. The heat factor is medium.Overall, this is a sweet story with the powerful doing their best to protect the weak.

9381,"For much of this book I was riveted. Katie Hafner is a skillful writer and brings emotions to the page, while keeping the ""plot "" (if you can call it that in a memoir) moving along. It felt a bit long to me, though, which is why I didn't give it four stars. I know her relationship with her mother, and coming to terms with her childhood, is the primary topic of the book. But about 60% of the way through I started to feel like I was with a self-centered friend who never stops focusing on herself and her own endless psychological self-explorations. Enough awready, I felt like saying. (I borrowed it from the library and read it on Kindle Fire, which does not give page numbers...so I was surprised when coming here to review it, to notice that it is only 288 pages. It felt longer.)Hafner hits the nail on the head, many times. However, she glosses relatively lightly over her own ""sins "" as a mom (a second marriage that was terrible for her only child), describing her daughter's unhappiness in clinical and detached terms, and using emotionless, tepid words like ""regretfully "" when explaining her own self-centered choices and actions. The sudden ""arm's length"" approach in this part of the book is noticeable, because when describing her own mother's flaws and poor choices, Hafner expresses (beautifully) her feelings of pain...no arm's length there. The fact that Hafner wrote and published this book despite the fact that her mom is ""less than thrilled "" to be featured in the book is a fact one can't forget while reading the book.",4.0

9383,"I thought this was a great zombie/survival story. The writing was smooth and read well. there was a section about 60% into the book where the story lagged a bit, but overall was a page turner.  The characters were all given consideration, even lesser characters, making the reader be invested in their outcome. The author avoids common pitfalls of many books in the genre by creating believable scenarios and flawed characters that act, well, human. They make mistakes and don't have any ""superhero"" moments. They scratch and claw their way through the story trying to find a safe place. I look forward to the rest of this series.",4.0

9389,"Jet and Brooke do not disappoint in the last installment of this trilogy. The third book starts right off where the second ended. The story is fast paced with murder, deceit, abductions, blackmail, conspiracy and let's not forget the hot intimacies that will make your face flush red while reading. As I'm sure you suspect if you've read the other books in this trilogy there are quite a few hard turns and what you'll reveal around the bend might seriously shock you. So be prepared for some surprises before the end of this story. All the mysteries are resolved in this last book and you most likely will finish the last page with a feeling of contentment. The author stated they she will do somewhat of an epilogue slash novella type book to give an update on the characters in this trilogy but that it wouldn't really be a continuation of this story line but that she was also working on a new series for the year 2014. Highly recommend this trilogy as it was greatly entertaining; but prepare to loose some sleep as it isn't an easy book to put down.",5.0

9391,"O.K. If you noticed that Sheldon from ""Big Bang Theory"" picked up a grad student with his chat about ""Flatland"", (of course, without knowing that or caring about that), and if you accordingly became curious about the book, and if your interest is just passing, this free download is a fine and painless way to satisfy your curiosity.As many reviewers have noted this free public domain edition of ""Flatland"" has none of the original illustrations. But, this romance is in large measure the story of a thought experiment and it is explained so clearly, distinctly and effectively that no illustrations are really required. By the same token there are a few garbled words and a few formatting issues, (although not that many),and not nearly enough to frustrate understanding. (As opposed to, say, many of the freebie poetry collections, which are so garbled that they really are unreadable.)So, you could dedicate your life to understanding ""Flatland"" and all of the commentary it has spawned, (in which case you probably do need to see the illustrations), or you could read this for free and become that much more an accomplished and broadly experienced scholar. I'd encourage you to download this and read it. It actually is a charming, inventive and provocative work. At the very least you'll feel smarter after you've read it.",3.0

9399,"An autobiography about growing up in Leeds Castle in England and taking it all for granted.My TakeThe memories are from a child&#8217;s perspective, and a shy one at that. It reads like a sanitized version of a dysfunctional childhood, all very surface with little revealed. Sorry, read that as &#8220;understated&#8221;.Oh, perhaps that&#8217;s not a fair comment, but I grew irritated with Russell harping on about how living at Leeds Castle and having everything done for him didn&#8217;t prepare him for the real world. No kidding. What bugged me was Russell never gave any examples of how this screwed things up. It was so generalized.As for his outrageous fortune in living and growing up in such a fabulous setting, that&#8217;s all it was&#8230;a frame. There was nothing substantial inside it. His nanny was more of a parent to him than his own parents or his grandmothers. In spite of living with his maternal grandmother, he reckons he only actually spoke to her a handful of times. How sad is that?As fabulous as the house was, I didn&#8217;t feel as if Russell appreciated the history of where he grew up. Instead, lol, it was a child&#8217;s concerns and fears, which were all too similar to children growing up at any social level, although I think most children at the lower levels had it better with parents and grandparents who spent time with their kids, compared to what Russell was given. Yes, he&#8217;s never had to worry about paying the rent or affording food, but he&#8217;s never had the love or interactions one would expect from a family.I regret that his parents ignored so much of what could have benefited him as opposed to what&#8217;s always been done. It certainly sounded as if there was no interest in helping Anthony find purpose or find him playmates, and instead he spent his days with Nanny.He does mention the people who were guests at the castle, frequent and occasional, the famous, the political, and merely noble. He refers to the perpetual bachelors, a euphemism for gay, who paid court to his grandmother. How his grandmother&#8217;s &#8220;court&#8221; spent their year, the poor treatment meted out to his mother, his own experiences at boarding school.His father&#8217;s mother, Granny A, sounds like a single-minded rebel, a poor one compared to Granny B, but much more real. He mentions that she insisted there be no sex when Granny A married his grandfather, and I find that a truly odd insistence. Why would John Russell, Anthony&#8217;s grandfather, even marry a woman who didn&#8217;t want to produce children? I thought that was always the be-all, end-all for the aristocracy? Producing an heir?The CoverThe cover is sweet with a faded family photograph of Anthony and his brothers in front of Leeds Castle: David on his bike and Anthony leaning on the toy car in which James is sitting. A nice blend of the normal with the grand.The title is how Anthony sees his childhood, a bit of Outrageous Fortune.",3.0
9400,"There are some books that touch your heart and Heart Like Mine by Amy Hatvany was such a book for me.  I listened to the audio version narrated by Cassandra Campbell and she is fast becoming one of my favorite narrators.  I find the tone of her voice and her way of telling the story captivates me from beginning to end.  Heart Like Mine is an emotional and moving story that perfectly portrays not only the struggles of womanhood but also the joys and sorrows of families; even those not your own.Grace, at thirty-six years old, has never had the urge to be a mother.  She&#8217;s happy with her career and her life the way it is.  When she meets Victor, a restaurant owner, and learns that he has two children, Ava and Max, who live with their mother she really doesn&#8217;t think too much about it.  They stay with their mother for the most part and Grace pretty much stays out of the way when the kids are spending time with their father.  Things quickly turn around though when their mother Kelli passes away under questionable circumstances and suddenly Victor is no longer a part-time father, but a full-time one instead.Grace is torn because of course she understands that the kids come first and naturally her heart breaks for these kids but at the same time she is being pulled into a life she isn&#8217;t sure she wants.  A life that involves caring for the kids, picking them up from school, and all that other stuff that a mother would normally do.  Matters are made worse by the fact that Ava, at thirteen years old, is none too happy to have Grace around at all and takes every opportunity to throw it in her face.  Despite the fact that Grace doesn&#8217;t feel equipped to deal with the kids her heart really goes out to Max, who younger seems more open to a relationship with her and even to Ava who she feels is just acting out her grief.  Still she really has to question herself as to whether she can handle all the changes that have been thrown at her and ultimately she has to ask herself whether she is really cut out for a ready made family.While this barely touches the surface of the depth of this book I think the real impact of the novel is in the emotions that it evokes.  Whether you&#8217;re single, in a relationship, have kids or don&#8217;t, or have lost someone close to you there is some aspect of this book that almost everyone can find to relate to.  I found I related most to Grace in that I don&#8217;t have children other than my puppy and while I like kids I&#8217;ve never felt an overwhelming urge to have any and I like how Amy Hatvany portrayed that in the story &#8211; that it&#8217;s ok if you don&#8217;t want kids; that not everyone does and it doesn&#8217;t make you any less of a woman for choosing not to have any.  What I do know is that Heart Like Mine would make one fantastic book club pick!  Wow, there are just so many points to discuss in this novel ranging from blended families, having children or not having them, love, grief, and hope.  I just can&#8217;t imagine not having some really good talks arise from sharing this book with your book club buddies and to assist you there is even a Reading Group Guide.The novel is narrated by Grace and Ava with flashbacks to Kelli&#8217;s past and I think the audio version splendidly portrays the differences in the emotions of all these characters.  I&#8217;m not sure I would have felt the same emotional connection if I had read the book as I did in listening to it because you could feel the characters emotions coming through in the way that Cassandra Campbell brought them alive. For me Heart Like Mine was a beautiful book and I think the audio version just added that extra something special to it.  I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to recommend this book and if you have read it I&#8217;d love to hear if you enjoyed it as much as I did!",5.0
9401,"The author did a great job of writing a love story where the female did not need to be less than so that the male could be more than.  I enjoyed the character of Kit/Emily, who was real ( she has daddy issues),smart, resourceful (when dealing with her disability) and in love.  Of course, Logan was the cat's meow and the fact that the author gave him a disability and showed how he managed to navigate through the world and live his life, made him even more memorable.  I enjoyed the balance in their relationship and the sex scenes were hot, lolI noticed that there is a sequel to this story. I tend to avoid sequels because they usually end up being about much unnecessary angst and drama, which add nothing to the original story.

The wolf elders decide she is to be the mate of Merrick the next leader of the pack. She fights this revelation tooth and nail, but Merrick is determined to win her over.Fury is more about the erotic story than an romance story. You feel as if you are dropped in the middle of a standing book. The premise of the story really has potential to be a novel, if the story and characters were explored more and expanded upon. Since ANya Bast is a well known author, i believe her intent was just an erotic short story which she executed well. I just happen to love the story and the build up of rapport with characters as much as the hot scenes, which is why it fell flat for me.

9407,"This book covers the first three years of Buchanan's association with Richard Nixon, from 1965 to 1968. The opening chapter provides a bit of history leading up to that point. Nixon had been a very successful politician early in his career, elected to Congress in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950, then becoming Eisenhower's Vice President in 1952.  By 1960, only 47 years old, he had gained vast exposure on the world stage traveling on behalf of the US government and the Eisenhower administration.Despite losing the presidency, the Democrats had expanded their presence in both houses of congress and statehouses during the Eisenhower administration.  Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about two to one.  Eisenhower, who could have run on either party's ticket, was simply not a party builder for the GOP.  The lack of political infrastructure, and a consistently hostile press, were handicaps that proved impossible for Nixon to overcome.Buchanan has some good observations on the way the campaigns were run in 1960. They involved a lot of personal appearances, as neither candidate had yet figured out how to fully leverage television. When they did, it benefited Kennedy more than Nixon as he was the more telegenic man.Buchanan, as an editorial writer at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, saw what few others would have imagined: that Nixon was likely to be a contender again in the 1968 elections.  Quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes ""It is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived,"" Buchanan approached Nixon with an offer to serve.After losing to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon planned his comeback via the governorship of California. California politics was then as now a rather confused.  As always, the press treated Nixon viciously.  Unable to rally the support of the fickle California GOP establishment, the camp of Knowland, Kuchel and Earl Warren, Nixon lost to Edmund G ""Pat"" Brown, the father of the present Gov. Jerry Brown.  After his loss, he decided to wash his hands of politics, and the press was quick to dismiss him.Nixon moved to New York and founded the law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander. His national and international exposure was extremely valuable for attracting clients, and the firm prospered. Practicing law, however, bored Nixon, and he kept his hand in politics.  When Buchanan called, Nixon decided he could use somebody to help with the writing and the planning of his travels and appearances. He subjected Buchanan, young and not highly credentialed, to a very thorough interview before inviting him as the anchor member of his reelection team.The substance of the book starts with the 1966 by-elections. At that point Johnson's Great Society was in full swing, programs put in place with a veto proof majority in both houses of Congress. The Republicans were unable even to function as a loyal opposition, questioning the wisdom of Johnson's social programs or the war in Vietnam.The Republican establishment, Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Jacob Javits to name three, had refused to support Barry Goldwater actively in 1964.  Nixon, despite reservations about some of Goldwater's rhetoric, campaigned for him in 36 states.  Though the candidate was thoroughly trounced, conservatives remembered Nixon as a loyal friend.Again in 1966 Nixon took it upon himself to become the best-known Republican to campaign nationally on behalf of Republican candidates. He focused his efforts more on rookies, those without the advantage of incumbency, and earned a great many debts of gratitude as the Republicans gained 47 house seats in 1966.The press did not give him credit for the success, nor did they see him shedding his loser image or reemerging as a candidate for 1968. This contented Nixon. Leaving Romney and Rockefeller to fight it out for the limelight, he was satisfied to remain in the background, continuing to do good works on behalf of the party.The 1960s was a time of huge social issues and turmoil. While Buchanan does not dwell on the sexual and the drug revolution, he dedicates a great deal of space to discussing the antiwar movement and the race issue.The protesters against the war behaved as though their cause was so just, that the war was so immoral, that they were justified in breaking whatever laws were necessary in their protests. I observed it as a student at Berkeley in 1964. My take at the time was that these antiwar activists did not really have a coherent point of view, that the protesters could not articulate what they were fighting against and could not talk rationally about the war. They did know that they did not want to be shot at, and powerful social trends had eroded their respect for their elders, government in general and the war effort in particular. Their opposition had been subdued when Kennedy had been President, but it blossomed when the unsympathetic Southerner Lyndon Johnson took over.Buchanan's take at the time was authentically conservative. A society without rule of law, a society which cannot conduct arguments civilly, is not healthy whatsoever. It is a dangerous society.  It was wrong to indulge the antiwar protesters, as the liberal establishment and the media did.The same applied to violence in race questions. The liberal theory was that blacks had been held down, systematically mistreated, and now they were only demanding what was fair using the only means at their disposal. Buchanan's observation is that Blacks in America were materially better off than most peoples in the world, and were poor only in relation to whites. Moreover, Blacks had enjoyed relatively equal and open access to the benefits of American society. There were many successful Blacks that one could point to in the 1960s: US Ambassador to the United Nations Ralph Bunche, Sen. Edward Brooke, and many figures in professional sports and in business.  There were, in fact, many successful blacks even in 19th century America.  It simply was untrue to say that the blacks had been oppressed to the point that they could not succeed.The Black resistance, chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his articleRadical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, was not a just rebellion against oppression, it was a question of Blacks doing what they could get away with.  My view, as a National Guard soldier, echoed those of Wolfe and Buchanan.  I was driving a 2  ton army truck, trying to avoid badly parked Cadillacs in Watts. The irony was striking - Cadillacs in front of single-family homes are not a symbol of a poverty-stricken society. Moreover, curiously, the businesses the Blacks burned were the very businesses that served their communities in Watts, Hunters Point, and later Washington DC. The damage they did was felt most severely by their own people. Buchanan, as a native Washingtonian, felt the injury when the Blacks in 1968 burned the seventh and fourteenth Street corridors of that city.Buchanan quite accurately saw the Soviets as duplicitous and opportunistic. He recounts how they goaded Nasser to start a war with Israel, and then did not back him up when it blossomed into a real fight. It is exactly the same today.  Putin has induced a motley collection of rebel forces to start fights in Ukraine, but seems unwilling to back up these people that he encouraged to start trouble on his behalf.  As an aside, not in the book, it amazes me that Buchanan is able to claim that God is on Putin's side simply because the West has become so godless.  He may recall that Hitler also claimed God. In any case, Buchanan's accurate descriptions of the Soviet activities in the 1960s are pretty much identical to what is going on in the teens of the 21st century.[British PM Douglas-Home's] focus was on Russia's role in the recent war. The Soviets are in this thing ""up to their necks,"" he said. They have twin goals: make Nasser dominant in the region, and, through him, gain a Soviet foothold in Africa. Asked how this affected ""detente,"" Sir Alec said the Soviets move when they see an opportunity. They always have. Like a knife, they push ahead when they hit butter, and back away when they hit steel. Where they run into unity and strength, relations tend to improve. Soviet policy seeks ""a maximum of confusion for a minimum of commitment."" The Soviets did not intervene militarily in the Arab-Israeli war because they do not commit their military power far from their homeland.""Buchanan quotes Churchill as saying that ""The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion.""  That is true, and the small states currently in play are Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldoa and Ukraine.  I remind Pat should he be reading this review.This book is a satisfying read in a great many ways. Buchanan is as articulate and consistent of a conservative voice as one will find in America. It is a remarkable piece of history for him to have witnessed as a man in his late 20s. He was close to the centers of power, with keen powers of observation, and half a century later he is well served by a great memory and a great many archives to draw from. This book is altogether a five-star effort.",5.0

Can Colton the love of her life show her that there is still love between them and can he fight to be with her even if her secrets and her daddy's secrets come out? This book had some twists and turns that I couldn't believe. But don't think I didn't want to smack the crap out of Carly Jo in this book sometimes. She makes a huge mistake and I can only pray for her sake that her life starts to work itself out. You will love this book.",4.0
9423,"Billed as the last in the Detective Erlendur series, this was possibly the best of the series.  The reviews here have accurately described the story line as well as the harsh and fiercely cold environment.  This is a melancholy tale, with  little happiness shining through, but it meshes well with the story lines.  The ending is written in such a way as to be final, but if Indridason has seconds thoughts about terminating his leading protagonist, might he spin it in such a way as to plausibly allow him to return?  We can only hope so!",5.0

9428,"There are many &#34;Mary's&#34; mentioned in the New Testament. Which one are we talking about here? Mary of Bethany was a quiet woman who loved the Lord. She chose to anoint His feet with precious ointment and was blessed by Him for that act. Judas, always looking at the money angle, thought it should be &#34;sold.&#34; But, Mary chose to give it to Jesus in a very humble, emotional way. Mary also chose to sit at Jesus' feet and listen instead of serving, much to her sister's chagrin. That was a teachable moment for Martha. So, you might ask, what does this have to do with me? What is its relevance to my life? In her new book, Dolores Kimball takes us on a journey to discover Mary's secrets. In this Bible study, she gives plenty of Scripture to go along with the story she tells. So come along and gain insights on life choices, listening, silence, worship, and peace.Mary of Bethany is one of my favorite Bible women and I was happy to be offered a review copy of this book. As I went through the book for this review I quickly found that I want to go back and take a longer time period to really dive into the Scripture and study with Ms. Kimball.

9446,"&#34;In the Blood&#34; is an extreme psychological thriller about people who have inherited psychological (and sometimes psychopathic) problems. These issues may be disturbing to some readers.Lana Granger has experienced great psychological stress in her youth, especially when her father is convicted of killing her mother. Lana was in the house at the time of her mother's death and her father made her help him dispose of the body. Lana's Grandfather was a convicted murderer.Now in her early 20's Lana is stable under a cocktail of psychotic and anti-depression drugs and amazingly she decides to study child psychology at college. Her psych professor finds her a &#34;suitable&#34; part-time job looking after an 11 year old boy, Luke, after school. Luke has a genius IQ but attends a special school because he has already been diagnosed as a violent control-freak psychopath.Luke's mother, Rachel, has had terrible experiences as a single mother bringing up and controlling Luke (there is no mention of his father).  For safety she locks Luke in his room each night. She welcomes Lana's help as others haven't been able to connect with Luke.This unbelievable connection between two seriously affected individuals starts up a dangerous liaison. Luke likes to play games that give him control of people in his life, especially his mother and now Lana. With the disappearance of her best friend, Becky, and the impact of Luke's sick mind games Lana struggles to maintain her sanity.While this was a well written book, especially the flashback diary sequences, the extreme and far-fetched psychological issues that underpinned this book made it difficult for me to really enjoy it.",3.0
9447,"Todd S. Purdum has written an excellent book about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This Act and the Voting Rights Act of the following year are rightly associated with the transformation of the nation away from the most vicious aspects of post-Civil War racism. The immediate context for the 1964 bill was the struggle to end segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, a struggle characterized by the astounding bravery of the marchers and the terrorist tactics of the supporters of white supremacy.It is perhaps a little known fact that the federal government can enact legislation but has few means of enforcing it. Segregation in bus stations, for example, can be declared illegal by Congress, but local police may choose not to enforce the law, local prosecutors may choose not to prosecute law-breakers, and local juries may choose not to convict them. One goal of the Civil Rights Act was to address this problem by giving more power to the federal government to protect the rights of minorities who typically could expect nothing but humiliation and violence from the local authorities.Who will want to read this book? At the very least:o Anyone interested in the history of the 1960s.o Anyone who has readParting the Waters: America in the King Years, Part I - 1954-63andPillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65by Taylor Branch.o Anyone interested in the process of social change.Purdum does several things very well in this book. He introduces a wide cast of characters and describes them with empathy. He explains clearly how the time was right for this Act and how the forces aligned to make a reality. He helps us to understand the mindset of the segregationists: how they resented the 14th amendment (guaranteeing equal protection before the law) as having been forced on them during reconstruction; how they could paradoxically use the word liberty to justify depriving others of liberty.The author also makes clear how different things were in 1964:o African-Americans could not drive long distances through the South because of the lack of places where they could sleep, eat, or use a bathroom.o Liberal was not yet a label to be shunned. There were liberal Republicans such as Rep. John V. Lindsay, the future mayor of New York.o By percentage, more Republican senators supported the bill than Democratic senators. In fact, the Civil Rights platforms of the two parties in 1960 were nearly identical.o Segregationists did not hesitate to assert the superiority of the white race.In the end, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, having endured months of filibusters and arcane Senate rules. Readers will heave a sigh of relief when the final roll-call is tallied. But we also are too aware of what is coming: the Vietnam War, urban riots, and white backlash. Nevertheless, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the heroes from the streets of Birmingham to the corridors of the Capitol who made this Act possible.",5.0

This is in essence a very pleasant, Long - Short story.  Would have liked a little more technical detail about what and how steel would be produced using the stories scenario and more development of the characters.As a general statement concerning the series as a whole, I would like to see in all of the Ring of Fire series some consideration given to differing standards of beauty.  The downtime female protagonist is &#34;beautiful&#34;, but in reality how would a typical uptime man view a woman with very hairy legs and other body parts.  Obviously standards of beauty change with both exposure and experience but I've always been bothered by the &#34;love at first site scenarios&#34; in the Ring series, especially in the 1632 and 1633 time frame before experience has reeducated our standards of beauty.

As I read this book, I had my Bible right beside me, reading each selected passage she used. I thoroughly enjoyed this study.Mrs. Blight explores five areas of Christian belief by devoting one chapter to each concept. Inside each chapter, she breaks the topic into five smaller units of study.She shares her heartbreaking personal crisis that happened shortly after she graduated from college. She tells the reader how she came to give all her anger and hurt over to God and how God has used her to minister to other women.I would recommend this Bible Study to any woman who truly wants to grow in the Lord.

9465,"Data from the US Census Bureau shows the number of Americans who divorced their spouses in 2012 increased for the third year in a row to 2.4 million.  The increasing divorce rate comes as the marriage rate in the United States has plummeted to its lowest level in over a century. Since 1970, the marriage rate in the US has declined by almost 60 percent.So what does all that mean?  It means that there is something basically wrong with marriages in the US.Sherri Mills, author of I Almost Divorced My Husband But I Went on Strike Instead, has written a very insightful book that highlights some of the problems. Ms. Mills is not a researcher, psychologists or marriage counselor - well not as we normally think of marriage counselors.  Ms. Mills is a hairdresser whose career spans over 40 years. During that time she has heard the full range of marriage problems, from both men and women, and has come to some very simple but effective suggestions for improving the success of most marriages.This book is not about marriages where there are deep psychological or behavioral problems.  This book is about your everyday marriage, where two people start out totally in love but gradually drift apart, resentment builds up and they eventually decide the marriage can't be saved.Ms. Mills based her insights on her own marriage.  She was trying to do it all, hold down a full time job, do all the ""housework"" and take care of the children.  Her husband felt his responsibility to the marriage was to provide an income.Our cultural beliefs about marriage are still rooted in a way of life that no longer exists.  Most men still expect the wife to handle all the housework.  Most wives accept that their role is to do ""the woman's work"".  But with more and more women working outside the house, that unbalanced division of household chores no longer works.  And there can be a lot of resentment built up over an unbalanced sharing of the workload.One of the most telling things Ms. Mills found when talking to women about the problems they were having in their marriage was that they had failed to communicate their concerns to their husbands.  They expected their husbands to know what was wrong.  Failure to communicate the wants and needs lies at the foundation of marriages that are doomed to fail.Ms. Mills writes in a very down to earth, conversational tone.  The book is filled with numerous examples of marriages that encountered difficult times because of the imbalance in sharing of household chores and the inability to effectively communicate the resentment associated with it.Unfortunately far too many women have come to believe that divorce is the answer to an unhappy marriage.  As Ms. Mills points out, some marriages can't be saved - those with abusive spouses, addiction problems, etc. But, for many women, getting a divorce only adds to the problems.  ""A 2012 General Accountability Office report found that after divorce, women's household income fell 41 percent on average. The income fell 20 percent for men.""For those marriages that have simply drifted apart and are suffering from adhering to cultural norms that are no longer workable, this is an excellent guide which could save your marriage.I was provided a review copy of this book.",5.0

Claire had a huge crush on Ty, and when they run into each other in Las Vegas things get a little crazy. Ty and Claire end up in a twenty-four hour wedding chapel and get married. The next morning Claire&#8217;s dreams are shattered when Ty says he has a girlfriend and that Tawny is the one he wants to marry.Fast forward five years, Ty reenters Claire&#8217;s life but she&#8217;s not alone. She has a five year old little girl  . . . Ty&#8217;s daughter. When it is revealed that Ty is the father, the relationship between Addie and Ty is a precious daddy and daughter one. Ty dotes on Addie, and it is super sweet.The banter between Claire and Ty is both hilarious and frustrating, as you can see the writing on the wall.Becky writes a great romance, however this is not just a great summer romance that will keep you up late into the night. It is a book about accepting and giving forgiveness, not only from each other, but from God.

9474,"wow. oh wow I am speechless I mean speechless at how beautiful and amazing this book was. The writing was powerful and draws you into this web of intrigue and memories. the adage oh what a tangled web we weave does come into play here.the writing: beautiful. The flow was perfect and the descriptions were intriguing. I like how this is written like a chess match with live people and emotions. The emotion can be felt through the words used. Oh and the cloth scene. Le sighthe plot: the love triangle angle was a continuation from the previous books. the added bonus of the stories Nora tells is amazing. the vengeance and punishment concept is intriguing. Not a new plot but with how Ms. Reisz has written it you have a new outlook on what can happen when betrayal and heartbreak gets entangled with a disturbed, callous, self centered self absorbed individual being on the receiving end of that betrayal.the characters: let's take them individuallyGrace: she got on my last nerve at times. I mean coming on to Soren when he was in despair and about to make the toughest choice of his life. Except for Soren it wasn't. Here is Grace coming to America to see Nora and than she goes to the penthouse and demands to be in the know. demands I mean come on you don't know her as well as everyone else. Than her arrangement with Zach is odd but okay. What gets me though is how she was with Soren just didn't like. Overall she was okay but I didn't like her blatant ways with Soren.Marie: Kingsley's sister. The self absorbed who has Nora. You couldn't have created a better evil yet freaky character. At times you felt a wee bit and I mean a miniscule wee bit sorry for her only because of how she perceives her brother's love and all the betrayal in her life. I love how whackadoodles she truly is.Kingsley: He is the King for a reason. His love for Soren and Juliet know no bounds. He is brave and when it comes to his sister loyal. He even shows some morals on killing. His desire to protect is beautiful and we even see his love for Nora. He shows respect to Wesley as well.Wesley: Okay there were times I wanted to go AHH! He is a enigma at times. He loves Nora no doubt but he was starting to grow feelings for Soren's niece. Watch that one bub that is Soren's niece and he is a Sadist remember. Wes is the perfect oxymoron. he is vanilla in love with the idea of Nora who is a ex dominatrix. Wes can never go anything but vanilla. I truly believe he is in love with the ideal of Nora the person he believes she can be in his mind. He admires Nora and respects her but I don't know if it is a soul searching love. How he is with Soren's niece is beautiful though. He even begins to like Soren.Sorenthere are no words to describe this amazing incredible beautiful gorgeous kind sweet priest. those words pale in comparison to what he is. A gentle soul. Yes he is a priest and sadist but he is still a compassionate and beautiful man. His willingness to sacrifice is incredible selfless and beautiful. How he opens up in this book is sweet and tender to see. The many facets of Soren are seen. The only aspect that I found disturbing was the last scenes with Grace. I guess because in all the other books he adamantly declared the only woman he would ever be intimate with is his eleanor and this woman has this beautiful declaration broken. i loved his tenderness with Eleanor and what he was willing to do for her.Nora: Still funny, sarcastic and a firecracker. her stories will have you laugh, cry and smile.A absolutely beautiful and incredible book that will have you hanging on every word.",5.0

9476,"** Spoiler Alert**First thing, I read this book as soon as it came out and debated on writing a review.  I was taught, if you can't say something good, don't say anything at all, but I just have to.  In all the books I've read, over 500 in the last three years, I have never been disappointed in the ending, until now.  I was so excited when I started this series, I read the first two books in two days, and before the third book came out I read them again, just as quickly.  I was drawn to it by Blane and Kat's love story, two lost souls who found each other.  Kade irritated me from the beginning, he was like a gnat that kept flying in your face and you just wanted to smack it. He claimed that he loved his brother so much, yet he had no problem putting the moves on Kat whenever he could, even though he knew Blane was in love with her.When the fourth book came out, I lost all respect for Kat and never had respect for Kade.  For someone who didn't want to come between the brothers, she sure changed her tune quickly.Before this book came out, I stayed away from reading anything about it, because I didn't want any hint as to who she chose.  So I was highly disappointed when I saw the table of contents, it told me who it was immediately, all it mentioned was Kathleen, Kade, and Kathleen & Kade, no mention of Blane.  I almost didn't even read the book.  Than, her being pregnant with Kade's kid , a quarter of the way in, I almost quit, but I continued but with a heavy heart, skipping parts along the way, just to get to the end.I understand that this was the only way to end it so that everyone could stay in each other's life.  Blane is the strong one and he can handle her choosing Kade, cause if she would have chosen Blane, Kade probably would have killed himself. What I don't understand is how Blane, the main character in the first books, turned out to be a secondary footnote in the last.  Why the knife had to be twisted in his back so many times (3 kids), just for one mistake in judgment, believing his uncle, the man who raised him.  Trust me, I would have believed him too, if I witnessed how Kat and Kade acted around each other.  This could have been avoided, if Kat would have told him what his uncle did in the first place.  I also think the relationship between Blane and Brenna is totally out of left field and an insult to our intelligence.I honestly do not see how Kade can be the better man for Kat.  He is a killer.  He killed 10 people, in cold blood, in the time he left her with Blane.  He shot her friend's boyfriend and would have killed him if Blane didn't show up, just cause she wouldn't tell him where Kat was, with no repercussions.  I'm so tired of how he could get away with doing and saying anything he wants, just because he was so abused as a child and his poor pitiful me, I don't deserve love act.  I think no matter that he put the word out that he was dead, someone will find out he's alive and will be looking for him and they will be watching their backs constantly.  What a life for their children.The only good part in this book, was the time spent with Blane.  He was so sweet to her.  I'm sad, cause he really loves Kat, and will always be there for her; and will live his &#34;content&#34; life, and probably never love again.I think there should have been alternate endings, and you choose which one you want.

9481,"Ordering this book was a mistake, on a couple of levels.  First,(my bad!) I didn't read the description detail, and thought it was another of his wacky, off-the-wall novels about Florida and it's population of crooks, con-men, sleaze-balls and land developers. (Florida is a lot like Alaska in that sense).  I didn't realize it was a collection of his Miami Herald columns.  I had not been exposed to his columns before, we don't get a lot of copies of the Herald here in Alaska.  However, now that I've read this collection, I realize that instead of being just novelist with a wicked sense of satire, he's another liberal, progressive, environmentalist, anti-gun, Bush-bashing partisan hack that would be perfectly at home on the editorial staff of the NYT.  In one sense, he's like Obama.  He &#34;has a gift&#34;.  Too bad that like Obama, he uses it to advance the progressive agenda.  I won't be buying any more of his books.",1.0

I can see that an author in their haste to write the story line as it flows might miss some words. Sometimes your brain goes faster than your hands. But, it is absolutely necessary to have a friend or someone with some objectivity to read the item and indicate that words are missing. I'm not even picky when it comes to proper punctuation, but a lot of missing words cause the reader to have to continually re-read to absorb the author's true meaning.

9491,"The prologue is promising. Salvatore summarises the more impressive and epic exploits of Drizzt and King Bruenor. Sadly, everything else is slapdash and haphazard.Not only are all characters beyond Dahlia given a cursory introduction and background at best, but the padding is blatantly obvious and excessive. Nothing is interesting, and the combat is needlessly long-winded, wordy and dull. It's as if Salvatore needed to reach a pre-specified word count rather than tell a gripping story. Most of the villains (who, presumably, will have their plotlines and motives fleshed out and concluded in the latter books of the Neverwinter saga) are cookie-cutter, self-obsessed and motivated by power and/or revenge. When half-demon tieflings have no qualms about slaughtering their own brethren, you know the author has given up on coming up with original or even complex and well-rounded ideas.The ending is so derivative and dull that it's not worth dignifying through criticism.",1.0

9501,"As the owner of an appreciatively loving dog, previously rescued from a puppy mill, I knew I had to have this book when I saw it was written from the dog&#8217;s perspective.  I believe our canine friends have much to teach us, and in this way the author did not disappoint me.  I enjoyed the book, especially after watching my own dog single out hurting people and pay special attention to an ill family member.Mark has certainly caught that quality in creating the character of Wrigley, the mixed-breed &#8220;house dog&#8221; who tells the story about life in an assisted living facility.  This book provides an appreciative look at a dog&#8217;s world without excessively endowing Wrigley with human characteristics.In this way, Mark Asher seems to know dogs, but what really &#8220;ails&#8221; Mark is that he has scarcely a nodding acquaintance with grammar.Case in point #1:  &#8220;he felt badly...&#8221;  Really?  Was his sense of touch incorrect or improper?  When the verb to feel is used to describe an emotion, it requires a subjective complement instead of an adverb.  The adverb badly describes the verb, not the pronoun he.  If Mark wanted to describe how he was feeling emotionally, the appropriate word is bad.  To his discredit, Mark repeatedly makes this mistake.Case in point #2:  &#8220;he was doing alright...&#8221;  Impossible!  The English language contains no such word as alright.  Maybe that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s pronounced in casual speech, but the proper expression involves two words, which are all right.  As in Case #1, I can accept Mark&#8217;s using alright in a quoted speech by one of his less-than-accurate characters, but not in his own narrative.Perhaps there were no books on grammar for Wrigley to read at his assisted living home, but Mark should know better.  Since this is his first attempt at fiction, he would do well to acquire an English grammar.  Used copies of the Harbrace Handbook are available on line for only a penny (an excellent investment).Am I being picky?  Yes, but anyone who aspires to succeed must learn to use the tools of the trade.  The essential tools of a writer are words, so finding and using the right word is a basic requirement.  Far too many good stories are buried beneath the quagmire of poor grammar, and the author&#8217;s love for dogs deserves better grammar to describe it.",3.0
9502,"I got this book for my sister who has two young children. One is two years old and has asthma which has been keeping her up at night. She always looks so tired and I've been trying to convince her to get professional help with no avail. This book did the trick as it was a short easy read and she's a busy mom. It had a lot of great techniques which she told me she's been trying out. It answers a lot of questions that I think all parents have, the amount of sleep they really need, how much sleep infants need, are their problems with their own child's sleep, how can they get their baby to sleep when they wake up crying.

So far, it has not affected me adversely. In fact, it has helped cut down the number of days and alleviate the intensity of the flu symptoms when I do get it.Twenty two teenagers from the Bloomberg High School thought the same thing.  Nothing would happen, right? They were wrong. They were prepared for possible headaches, sore arms, possible slight fever. They were not prepared to hear everyone - telepathically. So now they know everyone's secret, what everyone was thinking. That would be perfect, right?Don't Even Think About It is funny, sarcastic, revealing, poignant and engrossing. Be prepared to get immersed in teenage insecurities, angst, crushes, young love and betrayal.Forced to band together to deal with their new sensitivity, personalities who would normally not band together suddenly find themselves as part of a tight knit group. Preconceived notions and biases are slowly broken down as the group find themselves working together for support and understanding.  Sarah Mlynowski cleverly develops different plot points as she explores how this new talent influences relationships and decisions. Do you know that saying ... about being careful what you wish for? Well, these high school teenagers find out the hard way what it truly means.Life as they know has undeniably changed for the Bloomberg 22, and they will eventually be called to make a decision about their future. What will they do?Don't Even Think About It is a quick read. I found the story engaging and entertaining that I finished reading the book in two days.  It is suitable for preteens and young adults.

9509,"The disappearance of a small child and the traditional structure of upstairs and downstairs collide in this Neo-Gothic tale shrouded in mystery and hidden secrets. Tyringham Park takes the reader into the complicated hive of the fictional ancestral Irish estate of the Blackshaw family where the staff may charm guests with obedience and structure but conceals behind closed doors sinister thoughts, poisonous gossip and dark resentment. Immediately the novel opens with the disappearance of the Park's darling little miss, the confusion that follows leads the reader to be marched from each station introducing them to each member of personnel and their whereabouts at the time of the child's disappearance. The observer soon becomes privy to the complicated relationships of those who share the prominent walls of Tyringham Park, the facade of privilege and status quickly falls and the misery and pettiness is exposed that reveals that something is horribly wrong within this grand house.The mystery continues to deepen and July 1917 soon becomes the 1920's, 1930's and finally the 1940's as the story follows the lives of those left behind to pick up the scattered memories of the lost Blackshaw child and the story travels from Ireland to the Australian outback and back again with swatches of time lapses and flashbacks to the history and origins of certain characters. Tyringham Park confronts many different subjects and depending on the reader may enjoy this twisted dramatic story of what happens behind closed doors of those seen born with silver spoons in their mouths.In the end this reader was somewhat disappointed. I sorely wanted to love this Gothic inspired read but found this novel was a little overly seasoned with predictable and unrealistic drama. Although the novel shined at certain points and I loved the complicated relationships that dominated the characters and the daring venturing into certain taboo topics; there was just something that overall lacked in the delivery of the eras the reader was shown and the presence of foreshadowing revealed numerous major points too early in the novel. Still Tyringham Park provided an interesting experience that I would recommend for those readers who love a historical fiction novel that takes drama to another level and blends mystery and complex relationships with the magnetic aristocratic world of former eras.*I would like to thank Atria Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Tyringham Park",3.0
9510,"&#8220;Every time I let you get too close, I end up losing everything.&#8221;This read grabs you from all sides. There is as intricately woven mystery of a missing child that brings Kate back to where she lost her brother to an abduction and murder while she was indulging in a teenage romance. However, Kate and Tommy are NOT kids anymore. They&#8217;ve both suffered through the years as the result of that one night. Both are determined to remain professional and away from each other. The flame between them doesn&#8217;t care about their desires to stay apart. When they finally give in a little, that flame explodes into an extremely steamy, borderline erotic romance.I loved this story! Tommy and Kate are on fire and you so want them to move forward together, even if you&#8217;re not sure if they can.&#8220;And by her man, are you referring to yourself, big guy?&#8221;While investigating the disappearance of Tricia, they discover more about themselves and choices they made and choices that were made for them. Tricia&#8217;s story dredges up so many painful memories for both of them.I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery as much as the romance. Yes, towards the end, I had figured out the abductor.

Even knowing the identity, still left a huge surprise at the end!A must read for all romance suspense readers!",4.0

Her life drastically alters after she is attacked near school grounds, and the result of how that horrible incident affects her life and her choices after that.Resulting from the horrific event, she becomes pregnant and is placed in a predicament by the people who love her: to get an abortion. This book shows you how Dynah deals with her own decision, not one that she feels others have forced her into, and how by her own choice, she soon starts to heal from the pains of the past. She also learns that even through this, God has not abandoned her to suffer alone and that even through a tragic event, something beautiful can come from it.This book is definitely worth checking out, but at the same time, it will be hard to read through, and I will/am only recommending this book to those who can handle topics of rape and abortion.",5.0

9535,"It is so refreshing as a historical romance fan to find a new author that you adore.  It is like finding a precious gem.  I enjoyed Miss Molly Robbins Designs a Seduction so much I didn't want it to end.  Molly is an inspiring heroine, with wit and a good head on her shoulders and a dream of having her own dressmaking shop.  Carver, our hero has been living for quite a few years with Molly underfoot as his sister's maid, and no one is more shocked than he when he actually misses her presence in his home.  They have a connection.  She knows him better than others to even predicting his needs before he voices them.  When she flees her wedding and asks him for a loan for her business he cannot think beyond keeping her at all costs in his life.  This is a brilliant story that will hold your interest effortlessly.  Ms. Fresina brings just the right amount of wit, banter and passion to mix up a lovely romance you will miss when you finish.  Miss the characters, and all that is her writing style.  I promptly bought every other book she has written.  You will love this book.  It's a keeper.",5.0
9536,"3.5 StarsFirst off, I&#8217;m going to say I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Axel. It had me hooked early on with a very emotional scene, so I was really excited to read this next one. The intro to Cage isn&#8217;t quite at the same level, though. It&#8217;s almost an extension of the first book because it begins just before the wedding for Izzy and Axel, but told from the POV of the new couple who would take center stage. I was happy to see the other two get their happy ending, but it sort of diluted the effect for seeing Melissa and Cage meet. Then when they did it was a sort of insta-lust with only a bit of struggle to hold back on the part of Melissa.Mostly, I had to slug through until almost halfway through the book until a real plot beyond the romance emerged. Now this is just me, but I need the external plot to help build suspense and see what the characters are made of. There was only the slightest hints of it until that point, but once it kicked off, it really made the book so much more intense. I was really invested and wanted to see how things went. The story still isn&#8217;t quite as dramatic as the novel for Axel, but there is still some emotional scenes and some that really touched me.I liked Cage and his need to protect those he cares about. He can be so sweet. Melissa comes off as a bit too cocky about her looks in the beginning, but on the flip side I appreciated her ability to stick up for herself. This definitely set her apart from the previous heroine, Izzy, because she was so much stronger and tough. I grew to really appreciate her quick ability to see reason and not make silly assumptions without thinking things through first. The romance between her and Cage was rather fast, but that happens in real life and people do make it work. The author managed to convince me the couple was legit in their feelings and not many writers can do that with such a fast pace to getting to love.All in all, I enjoyed this book. I&#8217;d give the first half three stars and the second half four stars, rounding it out to 3.5. For those who enjoy good contemporary romances, I definitely recommend giving this series a try. I&#8217;ll be picking the next book up for sure!Note- I received a free ecopy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.",3.0

9557,"As a fantasy writer, I'm always searching for the perfect name. Medieval names, in particular, can be difficult to find, especially for women. This book had a great list for both male and female names. I liked how DiPastena took the time to indicate when a name was most popular or going out of fashion or restricted to a particular culture. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because I would have found it even more helpful if the author had included name translations since I prefer giving characters names that sum up their character, highlight an important aspect of or ideal behind the character, or is ironic. It's a great resource for medieval names and aids in determining whether a name will make your character part of the crowd or the odd duck out, but if you want to know the meaning behind the names, you'll have to compare it with medieval name sites (such as Behind the Name).",4.0
9558,"Now you probably want to hear about the book. In short, I loved it. It was fast-paced, full of wit and suspense. Each character came with their own baggage, their own horrors, that they had to face. Justine was my favorite. She was a real hero in this story, pulling folks together, leading the way when the path was not clear. At first I didn&#8217;t care for Donald the writer. He was a bit of a dick. But then we get a peek at his deepest horror and shame and I think my heart cracked a little for him. After that, I liked him quite a bit. Mark was also a favorite as he faced a professional quandary as a war correspondent &#8211; what to publish and what to delete, how much truth to tell?I liked that not everyone survived (because I do find it unrealistic when all the good guys survive a paranormal attack of some sort). The pacing was good (never a dull moment). And the mix of people was great &#8211; various sizes, various skin tones, single, paired up, widowed, etc. The ending was more upbeat than the other two Lorn books I have read, so that was unexpected for me (but I liked it!). I really enjoyed that the characters had to go through some tough crap, face it, makes friends with it, and then they could attempt to come out the other side. Nothing was just given to the good guys.I&#8217;ve now read three Lord books and quite enjoyed each one. This one did not disappoint and may have been even more enjoyable because it was an audiobook and I could listen as I worked.Narration: Glen Marcum was an excellent fit for this audiobook. He infused the story with tension, tenderness, pissed-offness, etc. as needed. Edward Lorn writes well, and Glen Marcum did a great job of giving those characters a voice. I especially like his voices for Lyle and for Justine. Oh, and Trevor (who sounded stoned throughout the book).",4.0

9562,"""The Little White Horse"" is a fantasy novel for pre-teens and adults by the always surprising Elizabeth Goudge. Originally published by the University of London Press in 1946, with glorious illustrations by C. Walter Hodges, it is  the enchanting story of second chances not only for 13 year-old orphan, Maria Merryweather, who is every bit as spirited as Anne of Green Gables fame, but also Miss Heliotrope and other adults who have lost the love of their lives through personal faults and family vendettas. This edition does not have Hodges's illustrations, but it retains the enchanting plot and wholly original characters like Marmaduke Scarlet, Wiggins, and Loveday Minette.NOTE: I was searching for a horse story as a birthday present for my daughter who adores all things horses. The little white horse has a very small, but pivotal role in the plot--unlike other classic and beloved horse stories like Walter Farley's ""Black Stallion"" or ""Misty of Chincoteague"" by Marguerite Henry.Pair with the delightful movie, ""Secret of Moonacre"".",5.0

But her money problems are nothing compared to the trouble that starts when she&#8217;s framed for the murder of an obnoxious drunk.Lucky for Maddy, the ghost of her dead sister and her three living sisters are on the scene to help. And help is exactly what Maddy needs&#8212;hardened criminals have descended on Vineyard, and one of them has lost a prized possession that turns out to be a treasure worth killing for.Dollycas&#8217;s ThoughtsI couldn&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this book and thankfully NetGalley shortened that time just a bit. I love the Garcia sisters. especially Tessa! Just because she is dead doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t help catch a killer.  This time Maddy is the only one that can see and hear her because she is the sister that is in trouble.Again these sisters rally together, this time to find out who is framing Maddy for murder. Maddy is the newest member of the Vineyard police force but when a prisoner is murdered on her watch, with her gun, she is quickly suspended until her name is cleared. Maddy&#8217;s sister just happens to be married to the head of the Vineyard&#8217;s Police Department. He begs the girls to let the police handle the situation but they just can&#8217;t keep from getting right in the middle of the investigation.Lipperman has created wonderful characters. Maddy, Lainey, Kate, Deena and Tessa have that true sister relationship. They don&#8217;t always get along or agree with each other but when one of them is in trouble they come together, one even from her &#8220;eternal peace&#8221; to help. I love love the little digs they send each other and Tessa is hilarious. Maddy filters some of her words as she relays to the others what was said.She has also written a very complex mystery, framing a cop isn&#8217;t easy. The story is full of so many twists and turns some even get  turned inside out. It was fun following the clues. There were more than a few surprises. The investigation even brings in an investigator from out of town that ends up renting a room from Maddie&#8230;.This story is soooooo goooooood!!!!!!We continue to learn more and more about these sisters. I am really excited for what happens next. What or who will bring Tessa back for another visit? Only the author knows but I can&#8217;t wait to find out!!",5.0
9565,"In Reckoning, Silver Blackthorn, our main character, lives in Martindale, a small village hundreds of miles north of Windows, the new English capital. At age sixteen, Silver takes the Reckoning, a coming-of-age test to decide her place in society. In these uncertain times, no one really knows what happens to the teenagers who disappear into Windsor castle. As soon as Silver sets foot inside, she becomes trapped in a world of suspicion and fear, unable to choose who to trust, or who to fear.Silver, like most girls in dystopian literature, is a free spirit. She doesn&#8217;t think the way the rest of society does, and she&#8217;s not too fond of how society decides things for her. Her best friend is named Colt &#8211; I love that name &#8211; and she constantly pushes the line of what she can and can&#8217;t do. When she gets sent inside Windsor castle along with the other Offerings, she learns the real mening of freedom and choice. She goes through a lot of character development throughout the book, and I loved reading her journey.Reckoning was a decent read, but it felt like a mix of Divergent and The Selection. It didn&#8217;t have a lot of originality. I didn&#8217;t mind that much that the setting didn&#8217;t sound original, but I had hoped the plot would offer more originality. The writing was simplistic, and there&#8217;s no lyrical prose to speak of. The book has potential though, and it&#8217;s definitely a fun read, and a good start to a series I hope offers more originality in its sequel. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4.0
9566,"A very different story. I like Don and the way love changes his behaviour. Can a person with this disorder change voluntarily? I think that's part of the fiction. it's a condition and not their choice, in my opinion, although I only read a little about it thanks to this book.",5.0
9567,"Other reviewers have covered the mystery and the romance angles, so I'll skip those parts--which were excellent, in my opinion.You know what I loved the most about this book, the thing that sets it above most of the books I've read lately? It's the heart of the thing, and Ronnie Ingels is the heart. Despite the fact that her job often brings her nose to nose with the worst in human nature, Ronnie still has room to like and trust her fellow man. And despite the differences between her home culture and the culture into which she's dunked in the course of the story, she doesn't come off superior or aloof. She's open to being charmed, and because of that, she charms the reader. If Ronnie had had a different outlook on life, she could have seen the natives as ignorant savages rather than as decent people.The author's bio says she lives in NYC (I forget which part) and, as this is my first Chillemi, I was a bit worried about how she'd present Texas and Texans, so often the butt of hateful jokes. But I worried for naught, because the author brought forward the best--Hoot, Bertha, Thunder, hospitality, innocence, optimism--as well as the worst. I won't name the worst characters, because this is a mystery, after all. Suffice it to say that someone has done murder, and murder in support of other, more profitable crimes. So the criminals exhibit selfishness, greed, dishonesty, and downright cold-heartedness. Still, there are more good, lovable characters than there are despicable ones, and I like that. A whole lot.Rumor has it that there will be more stories for Ronnie and the adorable Dawson Hughes, and let me tell you that I will be on board for those, too.",5.0

9570,"Scholarly, Enlightening, Educational, Mysticism, Profound and Intriguing are some of the words that best describe Author Stanislaw Kapuscinski&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Key to Immortality.&#8221;I have always been an avid reader of The Gospel of Thomas and am constantly in search of books that capture my attention and teach me in the process, especially as they pertain to different Gospels. The Key to Immortality accomplishes both those avenues in a compelling manner that by far outweighs other books discussing the same Gospel.While I am no theologian by any means, I do consider myself to be very profuse and knowledgeable with topics surrounding the bible, especially the New Testament. Most books I have read are cumbersome and not easy to read which don&#8217;t flow well. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I am a layperson thatis why I have not had much luck finding a book in this genre that truly captivates me from the start. That was not the case with &#8220;The Key to Immortality.&#8221; In this book the pages flowed effortlessly and for me I felt as if the words were written in away that everyone could understand and appreciate.Each of the 114 Logia discussed will present a different turn and outlook on things that will take your breath away and have an impact on how you view not only the Gospel of Thomas, but also your own life.In closing this book was mind-blowing experience that I was happy to discuss and add to my library. I rate it 5 stars!Correction from my last review. I just noticed I used the word, &#34;novel&#34; a few times which would mean this work is fiction, which it is not and was an error on my end.

The devotionals are short, about 5 or 6 pages each, and compare the Tolkien characters with a Bible character. There are questions for the reader's own life.

Since I took away a point for the editing I gave it back because it wasn't a bad start to a series. Good luck with it :)I wanted to give this book a 5  in the worst way. but I couldn't. I don't know where to start. I really liked the story as a whole. I loved Leo the hero. Alpha ... HOT HOT HOT.  His  buddies Dalton and Roman not so bad either.The author had it set up so you could see things from the hero and heroine's side and I like that.  Its just that the thoughts did not always match what came later in the book. It made you think one thing but it was another. Why would someone think "" I can't tell her this because of this?"" and later the thought wasn't even real?  Avery, our heroine goes with her friend Piper to where her friends brother ""Roman"" works and meets Leo. President of a MC club.  Leo is a super Alpha and Avery isn't sure how to deal with his ways. Not sure of my feeling for the heroine.  She is the type that someone says"" Don't stick your hand in there because a snake will bite"" but she does it anyway and when she gets bit looks at you surprised. There is also something else going on beneath the surface that everyone around her is keeping secret and Avery doesn't know how long she can deal with not being told the truth. It is really the makings of a great story with a few fixes.The Really Bad Stuff::::The editing is horrible. The word ""handsome"" is misspelled  ""mansome"" so many times I had to stop and think about its spelling before I typed it??  Words like soldier were ""solider"". Some sentences did not make sense because wrong words were used, so you had to reread them a couple times to get  it or figure out  who said what.  Avery's last name was Delaney in one place and called Donnelly in another.  I don't so much blame the author.

It is very well written and set during the Tudor era.Political tensions, power struggles, religion, and magic are all present as Protestants under Queen Mary's rule are forced to covert to Catholicism or be tried for treason and burnt to death.The story is presented by Meg as she serves the exiled Princess Elizabeth. Meg is also trying to hide that she is a witch while at the same time practicing her craft and discovering her emerging powers.The story picks up when a priest and his apprentice Alejandro arrive at Woodstock Palace.From there the story involves many betrayals, accusations, losses, and a building romance. Meg is loyal but not always smart.I really liked WITCHSTRUCK. For a story with such a great plot line I really expected to love it but I didn't connect with the characters as well as I should have.  I am interested in the story enough to continue on to book two and I am hoping the Meg grows more as a character and that connection I am looking for takes place.My Book Source: PublisherI received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

9612,"Many of us who are old enough to remember the TV movie about this understand it was a little distorted. However many people have read the true account of this occurrence and will enjoy this version very much. I liked the book and wish it could have had a little more in depth treatment of the main characters, but time and memory is quickly fading away the actual happenings of WW2. My parents are both dead, my uncles and many of my neighbors, and history is quickly forgetting the courage of that generation and the sacrifice made. When this generation is completely gone what will happen to these stories? Thank you Stephan Talty for writing this story.",5.0
9613,"This story takes place mostly in a small town in the Napa Valley of California.  An enjoyable and well-paced story that held my interest all the way through.  I enjoyed the main and sub characters, who felt very real, and I found them to have depth.  The very quirky and loveable secondary character, Patty, added a lot to this story.  The ending, for me, was not predictable.  If you enjoy romance, ballet and children, this is a good choice.",3.0

Once here we got a VERY detailed road map by COPEC (Mobil) of Chile.  These COPEC maps are available for sections of Chile (North, South etc) at the COPEC stations in major towns.The DK EYEWITNESS guide was good for the initial planning of our trip.  Then we used the MOON & LONELY PLANET guides for details.  Not all of the towns are listed in all three books so we always check all three for an attraction.Some of the reviewers panned the LP book, but we have found detailed maps of smaller cities that weren't available in the other guides and our B&B;'s didn't have maps.

I think I would enjoy seeing the characters and general framework of this novel continue on and develop further in series form.",5.0
9628,The first half was OK but it really picked up steam about a quarter way through. I really like the characters and their relationship.

It is a mother of a cliffhanger. Can't wait for book 2.,4.0
9629,"This book intrigued me with a decent (but short) plot and a really neat premise that I haven't come across before. I got it for free so didn't have high expectations, but was confused. I found it searching for New Adult Paranormal Romance books and this is the typical chaste Young Adult novels. Not that I was looking for blatant smut but I was hoping for character depth, sexual tension, and perhaps giving in to some passionate feelings like kissing and such. The only sexual scenes are of torture and attempted rape.  It is extremely short and not well written. The dialogue is contrived at times, characters underdeveloped, and there are contradictions throughout that confuses the reader. I can't bring myself to even buy the rest since I could care less about the characters. If they were free I might read them just to see the plot through.",2.0

The whole storyline, however, was very unique.  There were new concepts of life and reality.  The characters and places were developed very well, and there were many different parts of the story to put together.  It was so imaginative that I had to finish it to see how everything came together, even though I became frustrated at the length at times.  The book did not disappoint in the very long end, but parts could have been shortened up with the same effect.",4.0

9635,"This little book is an important, humbling, and perhaps even frightening read. I have read no scholar whom I have greater intellectual admiration for than D.A. Carson and his book only furthers that admiration. Though this is a technical book, it was a technical-devotional read for me because it calls for both humility and exegetical fidelity. While reading through the Word Study fallacies I reflected on and was taken back by the extreme care necessary for the process of exegesis. While slogging through the 20 pages of grammatical fallacies I found myself discouraged and swore off the use of my limited language skills forever. The logical fallacies in chapter 3 were the most comfortable for me with some background in rhetoric, it was very helpful. The chapter of Presuppositional and Historical fallacies was also quite helpful as we consider the modern climate which we are ourselves members of, in which we are to interpret a text originating in antiquity.D.A. Carson has never been one known to be particularly gentle but I'm so thankful he concluded his book with this second to last paragraph...&#34;But I do not want to end on so negative a note. There is a danger that readers will conclude their perusal of this little book enslaved to deep fears about their own inadequacies for the task of exegesis. A little self-doubt will do no harm and may do a great deal of good: we will be more open to learn and to correct our mistakes. But too much will shackle and stifle us with deep insecurities and make us so much aware of methods that we may overlook truth itself.&#34; (142)As a non-scholar I am so thankful for the resurgence of evangelical scholarship and consider Dr. Carson to be a leader of this resurgence. His works are a gift to the church, this book certainly is no exception.",5.0

There is nothing clich&eacute; about this murder mystery, though it is written in a charming, old-style classical mystery tone, reminiscent of Agatha Christie and with all the suspense of Daphne du Maurier. The main character, a brilliant detective, is witty, sharp as a tack and quite refreshing and charming.The story line and mystery being solved in this book is a classic &#8220;who killed the rich lady&#8221;.

She feels a sense of betrayal because not only is Douglas her best friend, if it is proven that Douglas is the culprit, then he is endangering the life of Siria's beloved father, who is a firefighter.The story moves along, but there are some aspects that befuddled me. How could Siria be gallivanting around town at odd hours without someone supervising her movements and looking out for her safety? Yes, she is motherless and her father is busy with work, but it still seems too far-fetched to be credible. I did like the portrayal of Siria as a courageous young protagonist who is determined to honor her mother's dying wish to look out for her father, a Herculean task for a young girl.

9665,There are so many persons who go through life having to endure post traumatic stress disorder. I have met quite a few persons with this problem and when you are with them all you can think about is how they can be helped. To say life for them is not easy is an understatement. When I began reading this book I realized that there are ways to help persons who are troubled with this condition and it gave me hope. I read it all through and I must say I was impressed by the depth of knowledge and understanding the author has shown on the subject. There were things there that I had not known before and it helped me understand better what the disorder was. The steps are very interesting and I have tried a few on some friends of mine who have the disorder and surprisingly they responded well to them. I have not tried everything as yet but I feel it is best to ease into it. This book can be a great help if used in the correct way. How great is it to finally find ways to help those around us who we thought could not be helped. This is a must read.,5.0

9667,"The adventures of His Highness' supernatural agents Art, an artificial ghost only a few days old, and her partner Jim, an animated skull, continue. And I couldn't be more pleased. This time, while Art is still recuperating from the re-animationist case, she and Jim must deal with a bone stealer who uses his rather unique gift to remove and insert bones into another and adhere skin, muscle, tissue, and nerves without permanent damage - except to the one who unwillingly donates his or her bones.I was delighted by the first book in this series. (Read my review of Risen here.) So, I was expecting to enjoy Bones as well. What I was not expecting was to absolutely fall in love with it! From the artwork to character development to the beautiful Victorian London scenes, it was impossible not to love this novel.I know Elizabeth Watasin did a great deal of research for this novel, but I have a feeling that she actually lives and breathes this era, that she sees airships when she looks up and carts and hansom cabs on cobblestone roads when she looks around.The pace was perfect. We get to know more of not only Art and Jim, but the other characters as well. I was surprised, however, when the conclusion of the bone stealer case is revealed, for it seemed too soon. But, it made room for us to get to know some of the characters even better when they are not under the pressure of solving a case. And for that I'm grateful.I admit I am most fascinated by Jim Dastard. As an animated skull with phantom limbs, his manner of speaking is honest and, at times, funny, once referring to Art's &#34;Quaker tantrum.&#34; I was especially amused by the nausea in his phantom organs, and subsequent vomiting of coins, cigarettes, tobacco, and the like.The introduction of Delphia, Jim's new &#34;legs&#34; was an enjoyable addition to this novel. She impressed me with her bravery and open mind to the Vesta and its occupants.And speaking of the Vesta, one of the things that is most pleasing about The Dark Victorian series is the acceptance of unconventional relationships. While Art and Jim, two supernatural creatures, find not only acceptance, but friendship, among the staff and residents of the Vesta, it is equally satisfying that the other residents live without &#34;community condemnation or social judgment.&#34;Fans of steampunk will revel in the culture that is The Dark Victorian, while fans of fantasy will enjoy a good mystery laden with supernatural fantasy.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

I didn't have to slog through hours of useless &#34;why do we sell&#34; exposition to get to the &#34;meat&#34; of this book - rather, it was all laid out in ways that rang very true to someone with experience cold-calling.Simonsen clearly knows his stuff, and isn't afraid to say it bluntly.

Usually three sisters meeting three brothers or best friends - three books - I understand that authors have to make money but I think it is a lazy way to do it.Okay so to this book - it was good- well written - and moved along without trying to keep the characters and facts straight - So if you want a book you can settle back and relax with this would be one - I enjoyed it.",4.0

9684,"This book was GREAT! I went in this not sure what to expect; it was steampunk, but it was adult steampunk. I am a YA person, so I was a bit nervous. However, I had faith after reading Open Minds by the same author that Ms. Quinn would come through. And yes she did!First, the setting is so unique, even for a steampunk novel. The blurb is NOT lying when it describes the story as 'steampunk goes to Bollywood.' That is really what it felt like! I haven't read a book with such a cool setting in a long time.Secondly, I loved Ash and Aniri! They were both great characters. Aniri is a main character that you can't help but like; she's brave even when it is hard to be, she's a bit flawed, and she doesn't wait for people to do things for her, she does them herself. Ash has a bit of a Prince Maxon flair &agrave; la the Selection, which is partially why I enjoyed reading about him so much. He is a very enjoyable character as well.The story is NOT predictable, and that's something I just love! No matter if you think you've totally gotten it figured out, you never have until the very end. The author hints something will happen, and then she's like, &#34;Nope, that's not right! Think again, readers!&#34;Definitely something I would recommend. It's a very fun book, and I loved every minute of it!",4.0
9685,"Mrs. Richmond's learning approach in this Spanish Vocabulary book is excellent, but she indulges in writing about moral issues that serious-minded Christians would find repulsive... which greatly mars this volume for me.In workbook format, this volume starts with the alphabet and pronunciation basics, good for beginners and good to review for those who have forgotten Spanish from high school days, but it moves quickly into grammar.A GREAT bonus with this workbook is the answer key at the back, a very practical help for those who are independent learners.Dorothy Richmond's methodology is geared for practice, but in such a way as to make the learning delightful, like a table game ( in small steps ) that helps the learner to REMEMBER it.When teaching ""Yo soy... "" ( I am , which is used for an UNchangeable ""to be"" condition ) , she omits the explanation and replaces it with amusing and interesting sentences in which the learner must use YO SOY several times ... and will remember the condition too !For instance, to teach YO SOY  and DE ( of )  , she would say something like this, in Spanish:I am LA AMIGA ( the female friend ) DE  Mickey Mouse. ( So, who am I ? )The LEARNER responds on the exercise sheet: Yo soy Senorita Minnie.Thus, the learner practices reading YO SOY  ... DE....  and writing YO SOY ( son, daughter, friend, etc.).... using YO SOY in UNchangeable conditions !So, the exercises are fun, interesting, and entertaining. No drudgery whatsoever with doing Mrs. Richmond's exercises.The exercises include interesting facts from many popular areas:  sports, entertainment, current events, historical events, etc.However.......  being a serious-minded Christian, I winced at some of the afore-mentioned items she has put before her students' eyes. She makes references regarding Harry Potter as easily as she does  Adam and Cain and Abel. She has many ""interesting"" exercise sentences which include homosexuals and ""their"" off-spring ( ?).She makes reference to husbands and wives and their ""ex's""... yes , all a part of the sad reality of western civilization,  but do these unsavory and ungodly and sorrowful situations need to be put before a student's eyes as though the situations were NORMAL ?The students from broken homes whom I have taught during my teaching years were never at peace about their sorrowful situation with one ( or both ! ) parent /s  missing.  Something ALWAYS seemed missing from their lives and they looked yearningly upon the ""other kids"" who had NORMAL homes, with a Mom and Dad.For any such student who is from a broken home, or is the off-spring of an illicit affair, such reminders of the sorrow of their lives seem totally un-necessary and really, out of place in a language study book.Surely, there are enough clean-living personalities who are sufficiently well-known  that Mrs. Richmond and her student helpers COULD have chosen to omit the seamier side of life, just for once.How about Joan Woodard and Paul Newman, for starters, in the entertainment world ?( I cannot recall any clean-livers in the current political world, at the moment, but there might be some... )It so distracts from the intrinsic worth of the volume, that I am sad I purchased it.... and sadder that such a promising volume would be un-fit for Christians to learn an amoral subject like the Spanish language.It is a SAD commentary on the academia in this civilization who have allowed such ""realities"" of the unclean, baser side of life to darken, deaden, and clutter the learning resources, exercise books, and text books of this age... all  of which are put before the impressionable minds and hearts of the learners.Clean is BETTER.Yours for an un-reproachable conscience before GOD and man...Sr. Judith Hannah  + + +",2.0

9695,"Eleanor Catton, a native of New Zealand, was the youngest person yet, at 27, to have been awarded the Man Booker Prize. &#34;The Luminaries&#34; is the second of Ms Catton's novels. At 832 pages, it is a comprehensive work.The story takes place in 1866 in the gold fields of New Zealand. It is at once an engaging mystery and at the same time a weaving soap opera evolving numerous characters. To Ms Catton's credit she manages to keep the character development so well done that she supports her otherwise lengthy saga in a way that strings the reader along.In short the story details a mystery....who killed Crosby Wells, why was Anna found unconscious at the side of the road and what happened to Emery Stains?All in all the story is pretty good. The character development is excellent and the writing style wholly readable, which will appeal to a wide audience. On the negative side, and the main reason for a slightly lesser rating, comes the ending. The end of the book and the end of the tale seems to fall flat.....the reader is left wondering what happened after being engaged for  830 pages.Not withstanding my disappointment at the conclusion, I would non the less recommend you add this book to your reading list, and rate it memorable.",4.0

9699,"I loved this book!  The characters were all believable and I was surprised to find out who was involved (though I did suspect one, and i think the author made it very clear).  I was surprised to find that some I suspected weren't involved.The mystery:Lydia's husband had died in the fire that had been set to their house.  She had managed to get her son out but not her husband.  Her husband had a lot of secrets, but those secrets obviously hadn't died with him.  Now somebody was after her son, and Lydia escaped to an island hoping to keep him safe.  But when she met the chief security guard, she had all kinds of problems.  There was lots of suspense.  Lots of twists and turns occurred, which kept me reading.I loved the ending storm and all the mystery it entailed.  I thought the author did an excellent job in writing a detailed and edgy scene that kept me reading, wondering how it was all going to end!The romance:It didn't happen fast.  Slowly, the romance developed between the two.  They gave into their emotions and shared a kiss.  It's always refreshing when the couple doesn't wait until the very end and suddenly they are in love.  A man being a true hero for the woman he loved.  The romance was very sweet!Spiritual aspects:Excellent!  Lydia had lost her faith due to things that had happened in her recent past.  But as the book progressed, she began to see that Matt was right.There were so many aspects to this story.  I loved all the characters and trying to figure out who was guilty or innocent!  The author did an excellent job on this story!Oh, by the way:  I am a librarian, so I'll say it:  Bad, bad librarian!

Grew up with &#34;druggie&#34; parents and his father died of a drug overdose. His mother was sent to prison for her role in the drugs.

Will Tucker ever get his &#34;beauty? You have to  read this!! You have to read the story between Tucker and Paxton how their love holds them together thru all the bad things they endure together.My favorite quote from the book, &#34;Please make me a women tonight. Make me your woman. You have my heart, now take my soul.&#34;That quote alone should make you want to read this book. Loved the sex in the book. Its so hot and erotic.I gave this 5 stars for the love I felt between Tucker and Paxton. Tucker is so absorbed with Paxton and is the sweetest man walking and cherishes her dearly. She is his Soul Mate Forever. Paxton is so overwhelmed for the love she has for Tucker, her sexy rocker, her Soul Mate Forever.  The story is so erotic and so full of love between them. I loved it!!  Soul Mates Forever can be read as a stand alone novel but I plan on reading the first 2 books of the series to get a better feel for their friends and a feel for the love everyone shares in the story.

She is now a Professor of Law at Hofstra Law School, where she teaches criminal law and procedure.  So, I&#8217;m really surprised that she based her latest novel, &#8220;All Day and a Night,&#8221; on a completely unrealistic legal premise.&#8220;All Day and a Night&#8221; refers to a man serving a sentence of life without parole - &#8220;all day and a night&#8221; in jail jargon.  He was suspected of five murders but pled guilty and was convicted of only one.  That murder had a  &#8220;signature&#8221; of bones broken after the victim&#8217;s death.After the convict has served 18 years, another murder is committed with the same &#8220;signature.  The police assign two detectives to reopen the investigation into all the murders.  Meanwhile, the convict gets a publicity-hungry lawyer who convinces a State court in one hearing to release him. Within hours, the convict is free, with no motions, no conditions, no review.  When does that happen in the real world?This story continues with more irrational elements.  Other than that, the novel is a nice work of fiction: good writing; fine character development; good mystery.  Just suspend reality and enjoy it.",3.0

I liked that they both were willing to protect each other no matter the cost. However, it was a bit predictable. There also wasn't enough humor in the story to lighten it up a bit. Nick was always grumpy and Anna was always hiding behind her wall. Even when they have monkey sex together, they still weren't one.

9726,"From his cell, the narrator of The Enchanted tells us the story of the inmates, guards and other inhabitants of the ancient stone prison where he is being held on death row. Through his sometimes almost supernatural sight, he tells us of the Lady, an investigator hired by lawyers to try and get death row inmates out of their death sentences, the Fallen Priest, who struggles to make sense of the tragedy that caused his fall from grace, the warden whose wife is fighting a losing battle against cancer, and York, a brutal killer with a heartbreaking past of his own. As his own execution draws closer, the narrator draws all of these characters together in the enchanted place where wild horses run...An Amazon pick of the month, The Enchanted has received quite a lot of attention in the past couple of months. After reading the blurb, and hearing the comparisons to such great books as The Green Mile, I added it to my To-Read list, unsure quite what to expect but looking forward to discovering what it was all about. What I found was a heart-wrenching literary fantasy, definitely worthy of the positive vibes that have been rippling through the blogosphere recently.Told by a nameless narrator - whose identity is hinted at throughout but not fully revealed until the very end - The Enchanted brings together a number of disparate characters, all of them with dark secrets in their pasts, all of them struggling to make sense of the world around them and such concepts as justice, forgiveness and morality in a place where morals are a commodity and not a necessity. As our narrator skips between the characters, we get a fully rounded glimpse into the enchanted place that is this prison: a dark place where guards turn a blind eye to murder and rape in return for drug-money kickbacks, but also an enchanted place where the slightest act of goodwill can shine like a star gone suddenly nova.Combining fantastical elements with a harrowing examination of the penal system and an investigative subplot surrounding the Lady and her attempts to see York escape the death penalty, the novel is able to constantly surprise and astonish, drawing out revelations about characters that turn monsters into victims without shying away from the dark truths. While examining something as sensitive as the death sentence and the way we treat men and women in prison, The Enchanted never goes for the easy answer or the simple emotion, forcing the reader to make their own minds up or at least go away from the book asking themselves questions.Denfeld's writing combines short, sharp sentences with a poetic turn of phrase at times that culminates in a final scene that I defy anyone to read without at least a lump in their throat. Told mainly in the first person, the story moves skillfully between the characters, giving them all space to breath and develop despite the short length. While there are a few truly villainous characters (one each especially amongst the guards and the prisoners), most of them are far from simply cardboard cutouts - every single one of them has a story to tell.The ending is bitter sweet, depending on the characters, but most of the story questions posed by the novel are answered while the more philosophical conundrums are left - as I said above - to the reader to make sense of. The fantastical elements, while present, are left in the background and again it is left up to the reader to decide how much of them are real and how much of them are wish fulfillment on the part of the narrator.Harrowing and yet uplifting, dark and yet full of hope, The Enchanted is one of my books of the year so far and I imagine that it will be somewhere in my top ten by the end. Filled with real people and brimming over with beautiful, dark imagery, the book is a thought provoking novel that doesn't forget that the first job of any novel is to tell a story. I will most definitely be looking out for Rene Denfeld's next work. I gave The Enchanted 5 flibber-gibbets out of 5.",5.0
9727,"This series caught me by surprise, as I tried it without knowing anything about it. I instantly felt drawn to Flavia, as even though she is hardly credible as a preteen girl, she is totally believable as a character. Her passion for chemistry and her glee in mulling over the famous chemists of the past is a master-stroke. Her loneliness and &#34;difference&#34; is magnified at every turn, by the dreary post-war years, the family dysfunction, and the lack on companionship. I find Flavia's fondness for her bicycle very touching. My only caveat is that sometimes the author drags in other female characters who don't really add to the story, such as the gypsy girl. Hanging out in Flavia's bedroom isn't compelling.Otherwise, a lovely discovery. I hope younger readers will get into Flavia, she is a great character who promises to endure.",5.0

Of what was available, it sounded the most promising, but would not have been a book I would normally have picked up to read. But if far exceeded my expectations.The author created a great and likable character in Drew, the main character of the book. All through the book, he has struggles and doubts about God, which I can relate to, and is intent on doing the right thing, even when it isn't popular.The idea of the book is that due to an accident that temporarily blinds him, Drew is able to see what he believes to be alien invaders all over, who are trying to wreck havoc on people. No one else can see them but Drew, and he soon finds himself running for his life from these dark beings.I won't give too much away, but will say I caught on fairly early what these dark beings were, and found myself enjoying the story a lot. I had intended to read part of it and finish it another day, but I got into the story so much that I finished it in one sitting. This may be a book geared for juvenile readers, but I loved it. The ending, not so much, as I hate cliff-hanger endings, and it left me hoping that book two comes out soon.I definitely recommend it for teen readers, especially boys, but a lot of adults will enjoy it also.",5.0

9741,"I read it.  Start to finish, but mostly out of hard-headedness and being stubborn.  I enjoyed the SciFi and Tesla references, but truthfully thot the story line was juvenile.  The plot was bearable, but I kept wanting the book to be over and done with -- versus other, &#34;more adult&#34; books by Tom Clancy and others, where it's a regret that their 500-1,000-page novels don't keep going and going and going ...",3.0
9742,"Liked this one from page one.Lance Priest, known as Preacher by some, is a 21 year old college student. He sells used cars to make money.Lance is a super used car salesman. He never tries to screw buyers over and will sell them the best car for their buck. Lance has his own code of ethics.Lance is also a liar par excellance. He can tell a lie better than anyone and have everyone believing that lie. He's lied his whole life and the practice has made his life easier. Lance can fit in anywhere and his lies help him get there.Lance also has a photographic memory and a little out of body thing goin on.When he's out of body he can float above himself and any alititude, catch a clue about whats going on in the area, and make a decision on how to proceed. Pretty handly little ability to have especially when the CIA takes over his life.Lance filled out a questionaire he got in college. The questionaire was looking for folks interested in joining the Foreign Service. Lance filled in out, sent it in and promptly forgot about it.Lance was mildly surprised to be picked for testing. Lance, true to form, put down nothing but lies on the entire questionaire. A questionaire that will change his life.So begins one damned fine read.This one has Lance, his time in the Army, his training, his comrades in arms, his boss, his boss's agenda, a girl named Marta, jihadists, the KGB, loads of bad guys and Preacher pulling it off.Just one great read and well worth those five stars.",5.0

I will say, it started out a little weak, but it didn&#8217;t take too long to pull me in to where I had to make myself put it down to go to bed.Georgina knows flowers. She&#8217;s always loved them and even makes her living as a florist. Therefore, she becomes intrigued when flowers begin mysteriously showing up on her doorstep. She knows the meaning of each of the flowers, but is unsure of what her secret messenger is trying to tell her. It seems sweet and innocent until ominous flowers begin showing up along with the loving ones. She&#8217;s trying to figure out the mystery behind the flowers, but with all the drama going on in her life, she&#8217;s having a hard time focusing on the message. Between the return of her high school crush, Corbin, and the jealousy his return inducing in her best friend and employee, Sid; Georgina&#8217;s world is spinning out of control, and she doesn&#8217;t know how to get it back to normal.Corbin is the only man Georgina has ever truly wanted, but he&#8217;s never seemed to return her affections. When he suddenly returns and begins to pursue her, she&#8217;s taken aback. She tries to keep her guard up, but she can&#8217;t help falling for him again. When it comes to a man that sexy AND sweet, what sensible girl could resist? But Corbin has some secrets that threaten to destroy the relationship they&#8217;ve built. Will Georgina be able to forgive his lies, or will she lose the only man she&#8217;s ever loved once again? And don&#8217;t forget about Sid and his irrational behavior. Is he the secret flower messenger and trying to win Georgina over, or is he out to sabotage her and her new relationship with Corbin? Who can Georgina really trust? Buy this book and find out.As I mentioned, the story started out a little weak in my opinion, but don&#8217;t give up on it. It gets really good and is well worth plowing through the beginning. There are some grammar and punctuation issue, but they aren&#8217;t severe enough to affect the comfortable reading of the story. If you like a love story with some added suspense, I definitely recommend this book. It was an enjoyable read, and I would read other books by this author in the future.",4.0

He had been given her info by her sister the weekend prior.  The story follows their first meeting and night together.Night after Night (book 1) is the continuation for Clay and Julia&#8217;s steamy night together.  Clay is back in New York, but neither is ready to let go just yet so they book a weekend trip for Julia to visit Clay  Julia is torn as she has this big secret she can&#8217;t disclose which prevents her from being in a relationship.  Clay healed, but with lessons learned from a bad relationship is set on honesty and full disclosure.So while they are extremely compatible in bedroom with the sex is off-the-charts and their conversations/bantering on queue their agendas are not attuned.

Seven words to describe Clay: Charismatic, honest, commanding, flexible, confident, noble and open-minded.JULIA BELL, JULES: ~25 years/bartender/reddish-brown hair/green eyes.Unfortunately Julia Bell disappointed me in this story. In the prelude her keeping secrets came across as evasive yet necessary in a playful way.  But in book 1 Clay opens up about his past and makes it clear that honesty is everything to him and though I understand some of her reasoning (though  over-dramatized) I feel she should have revaluated and come up with a better solution to be worthy of Clay.Seven words to describe Julia: Selfish, misguided, secretive, assured, strong, focused, non-committal and spontaneous.Night after Night offered lots of steamy and playful sex, but story also allowed for the plot and the dialogue to develop.  As mentioned Julia failed me (Clay), but I am hoping she will redeem herself in book 3.

9754,"I cannot say enough good about this book. I was desperate to get my 2 year old to eat something other than chicken nuggets and noodles but was skeptical that he would try any of these. He is very suspicious of new foods and anything that is made a little different. For example, a quesadilla with cheese is ok, but add anything in there and he freaks. So I was skeptical of the zucchini quesadilla recipe but tried it. He ate 3 slices. I have cooked something from this book for breakfast and dinner for the past two weeks. He has eaten every recipe except one or two.Some of the reviews say that the changes are too basic and everyone knows them, but I had no idea how to make regular dishes into something he would enjoy. Every dish is made to cater to children with strict tastes, so I know something won't taste weird or too strong. We have also enjoyed the recipes, so I don't have to make two different meals.Another good point: Alot of the recipes use the same ingredients, so I just needed to stock my pantry and fridge with some staples instead of having to buy new ingredients for each recipe. I also like comments from moms about how to change up the recipes, which is one downside to paper cookbooks - not being able to read the comments on how people have changed ingredients.My only complaint is that in the past two weeks, I have spent a huge amount of time in the kitchen. It seems like these recipes are very time consuming, even though there will be a comment about how quick they are. But if I need to chop a bunch of stuff and puree some other stuff, then assemble it, that takes time, which takes time away from being with my child who is too young to help for longer than a couple of minutes. I will have to do alot of prep at night when he is in bed in order to make it work for the long term.However, I feel better than I have in a while from eating these meals, and I notice tantrums and snacking have decreased. I had never seen their blog but looked it up and found that all of these recipes and more are on their blog for free, so if you want to check them out before you buy the book, you can. Or you might just save your money and use the web, but I like having a cookbook in front of me versus a computer.",5.0
9755,"I was very excited to review this book to review.  A few days after I received it, there was a lovely Relief Society lesson given by a sister in my ward about the Sacrament.  Sister Reader passed out papers to all the sisters that read, &#34;What did you think of during the sacrament?&#34;  That sentence really made me think.  Usually I read the scriptures during the sacrament, but did I truly think about the Savior and the importance of the sacrament?  The next day at Family Home Evening, I was inspired to give a lesson about the sacrament.  We read this lovely book together as a family and used the lovely experience of the author to better our understanding of the sacrament and the importance of partaking it every week.  Also to encourage my family to be spiritually prepared to take the sacrament, and to be thinking of Jesus Christ, through prayer and the scriptures.My family and I will cherish this book and I am very grateful that it is in our home.",5.0

9766,"This book is a hot mess and is really hard to rate.  The writing was very awkward and confusing.  It sounded to me like it was written by a group of high school girls but then I saw the writer was only 22 so guess that explains it.  There were so many things going on that caused me to scratch my head, thinking &#34;who does that?&#34;.  You expected one of the characters to react a certain way in a situation but their reaction would be something totally different that didn't make sense.  The dialog was off too - how many 18 year-old girls who live in a trailer with a stripper for a mother say &#34;whilst&#34; and &#34;amongst&#34;?  All the long, heartfelt declarations of love with her father and stepmother got really old so I just started skimming those.  It felt like &#34;how do I love thee, let me count the ways&#34;!The editing was probably the worst I've ever read and I read 6 - 7 novels a week.  Spelling errors, crazy punctuation, run-on sentences, extra words, missing words, incomplete sentences, grammar mistakes, you name it, this book had it.  And it wasn't like one error per page or something, it was multiple errors in each sentence.  I lost count of how many times I had to edit a sentence several different ways in my head just to figure out what was going on.Harley was the biggest mess of all.  That chick seriously needed to stay single and focus on growing up.  The fact that every time one of the guys cheated on her she wondered if it was her fault was so incredibly annoying.  Even more annoying was how quickly she would take them back, especially Jace.All that being said, I still couldn't put this book down.  I think it had the same appeal that a show like &#34;worlds fattest man&#34; or &#34;woman with three heads&#34; has - you don't want to look but something just draws you in, some sick fascination you can't resist.

9769,"Unlike Hulk Gray, which explores unrecorded moments between point A and point B in the first day of the Incredible Hulk&#8217;s existence, Spiderman Blue is really just about Peter Parker narrating memories of Gwen Stacy and a recounting of brief, early battles with classic enemies of Spider-man (the Green Goblin, Rhino, the Lizard, Vulture and Kraven the Hunter). The story is not really so great, and the character development not so awesome either &#8211; it shows Peter spending more time with Mary Jane than it does of him starting up his relationship with Gwen.  But the art is great &#8211; cool shots of Spider-man swinging around the city, usually in some sort of &#8220;classic&#8221; pose you&#8217;d credit to John Romita Sr than to a modern artist. The fashions are funky, and there are not too many tedious scenes with Aunt May or J Jonah Jameson; the classic encounter with Mary Jane is not terribly impressive (too hard to out-do the original), but at least there are plenty of large panels, and tons of one-page and two-page spreads. Love it!! We also get to see more of Peter&#8217;s motorcycle, moving out of Aunt May&#8217;s house to become Harry Osborn&#8217;s roommate, Flash joining the army, all well-treaded stuff.Probably the most dramatic point of this book is the striking covers that Tim Sale comes up with, seemingly inspired by Reid Miles&#8217; work for Blue Note jazz records and mid-sixties pop art (there&#8217;s also a funny anecdote related in the end-interview/sketches pages &#8211; nice stuff here &#8211; that talks about how Tim was campaigning to put Aunt May on one of the covers instead of Gwen or Mary Jane!!!! Thankfully that never happened. The art is big and bold and full of dramatic colours, expressive faces, but also clear homage&#8217;s to Frank Miller or the John Romitas (Senior and Junior). The fashions are great, and they just go on and on. Funky wear-a-mustache milk-drinking breakfast scene in Aunt May&#8217;s house. Wellll&#8230; maybe not that funky&#8230; A very bad after shave joke. Mary Jane serving soup! Gwen reading Huckleberry Finn!Love the sound effects: Bdif! Squash! Floosh!

I really liked Symon and his patience and strength when interacting with Elena. As for Elena, she was torn between doing what was right and wanting to be as normal as she could. She could have trusted Symon way sooner because it got old having to read about her second guessing him when it was clear he was one who could be trusted.What I didn't care for was the author's frequent explanations and insertions into the story about the characters feelings. It felt forced. The interactions between the characters was enough to keep the story moving without all the extra.This was in a set of Five Unforgettable Knights and I had never read this author before. I don't buy into the healing processes Elena used and would typically not read books like this, but since the description didn't mention anything about it, I didn't consider that when I gave it three stars.",3.0
9775,"One day, maybe over coffee, several of the greatest romance authors of today got together and decided to write a series of books based upon the myth of the Arabian Nights and Scheherazade. Each month a different bestselling author will write a new novella resulting in the brilliant collection 1001 Dark Nights.The first installment in this delicious collection is Forever Wicked by Shayla Black. Forever Wicked is part of Ms. Black&#8217;s Wicked Lovers series and introduces us to Jason Denning and Gia Angelotti. Jason and Gia first met at Club Dominion where Jason served as Gia&#8217;s Dom. The two stole away to Vegas to get married but then tragedy occurred. Before they could enjoy more than one day of their married life, Gia&#8217;s brother was killed in the line of duty. Gia immediately rushed home to care for her depressed sister-in-law and her children, as well as her grieving parents. A police officer herself, Gia thought she didn&#8217;t need Jason&#8217;s help and could handle everything by herself. She pushed Jason out of her heart and her life.Fast forward one year later and Jason is determined to make one last ditch effort at saving his marriage. He blackmails Gia into spending time with him and allowing him the chance to win her back. What follows is a heart-warming story as Gia is reminded why she fell in love with Jason and learns to allow herself to lean on her husband.Gia is a fascinating character. It&#8217;s not often you see a police officer being submissive but I understood completely Gia&#8217;s need to let go and allow someone else to be the strong one. Family is a huge part of her life and her need to care for and help others has caused her to forget about her own wants and needs in her quest to be who and what her family needs.Jason is a Dom who only wants to take care of and support his wife. He&#8217;s also a billionaire who was raised by a mother who doesn&#8217;t know the first thing about love unless there is a financial payoff. Jason knows that he cares deeply for Gia and wants to take care of her but as to love? That&#8217;s something found only in romance novels.Forever Wicked broke my heart and then put it all back together with a big red bow. The death of Gia&#8217;s brother and the effect on the family created such heartache. Yet watching Jason caring for Gia and trying to solve all of her problems inspired me. Watching the two fall in love with each other all over again? Priceless! Ms. Black has a gift of creating characters who become so real that their pain is your pain and their triumphs are yours.If you are a fan of Ms. Black&#8217;s Wicked Lovers series, and you should be, then you know that the sex scenes are going to be hot, I mean off the charts hot! And Ms. Black was able to pack a lot of heat in a small amount of pages. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever think about chocolate mousse the same way again.If Forever Wicked is the standard set for the 1001 Dark Nights collection then I think us readers are very lucky. I can&#8217;t wait for next month and the next installment. Here&#8217;s to more collaboration in the future!",5.0

9777,"Hattie was a young girl when she moved to Philadelphia with her mother and sisters. Marrying young, she ultimately had eleven children. Her adult life and relationships with her children were colored by the deaths of her first two children, twins who died of influenza or pneumonia.  Hattie never recovered from their deaths, which turned her into a severe and critical woman who wasn't able to experience joy or express the love she felt for her other children. The Twelve Tribes of Hattie recounts the stories of each of her remaining children, many of whom suffered from mental illness and depression.Author Ayana Mathis explores the effects of tragedy, mental illness, depression, and poverty on a family struggling to get by in this book set from the 1920s through 1980. Ultimately, Hattie understands how she has failed her family, and resolves not to do so again when Hattie's daughter Cassie succumbs to mental illness and leaves her daughter Sala in Hattie's care.  It's well-written and compulsively readable, although I found the unending progression of sad and tragic stories hard to bear. Nevertheless, it provides much food for thought and discussion. This would be a good choice for book clubs and anyone else who enjoys contemporary fiction.",4.0

9779,"Originally, I got this book because it sounded like a bubbly story of a boy with depression. I think that is very accurate of the book. The book was wonderfully written. One of the best aspects of it was how relatable it was. You may wonder how you a mentally stable person could relate; the relating came through being stuck in a cycle. In the book, Craig just got stuck and he did not see an outlet out of his life. Though it meant tearing down his previous life, Craig  found a way out which would make him a hero to most people. Not only is this story heartwarming in the sense that the main character got his life back together, it gives us hope for our own lives.Though your life may not be the best, this book will surely remind you of how lucky you are and the importance of appreciating your current life. I was thoroughly impressed with the complex thought provoking nature achieved through this book. Though written very comically and lighthearted, It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story teaches you to respect those with depression and gives more of an understanding.Noted at the back of the book is the information that this book was written soon after the author got out of a mental hospital himself. This really gives even more perspective when reading it. I wish I had known while reading the book.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a comical story of hope. This book is not just for teens. Many adults could gain insight and enjoy this book.",5.0
9780,"Pretty good action packed story. I liked the storyline. It was creative and original. Every page kept you on the edge of your seat. This book was not slow by any means, but it was a little confusing and scattered to me. In the beginning it took me a while to figure out what was going on (and I do think the author did that on purpose, you aren't suppose to know right away).The character development was slow for me. I just didn't ever get a feel for the characters. I never really felt their personality. They could have been anyone. They also seemed much younger to me. I was very surprised when they said they were in their 20's (one even late 20's)! This story was also written in first person - so it is kind of harder to build the character that way in the first place. I didn't warm up to the characters at all.All-in-all this was &#34;middle of the road&#34; for me, not bad but not great. I will continue reading and reviewing the other two books in the series. The storyline was interesting enough for me to want to continue to read more. A big plus was that it was a fast moving book and had enough happening to keep it interesting.",3.0

9788,"I had a hard time with this one.  It seemed the whole first part of the book (that I read) was in her head with her commenting to herself.  She seemed awfully immature for her age and experience.  I couldn't figure the Aunt's age.  At first I thought she was quite a bit older than the niece, then she seemed to be just a few years older than the niece then I wonder why in heck she let her Aunt tell her what to do and when to do it.  She is a grown woman and she is told to come inside and not talk to the cowboy, her old friend. Really?  I didn't get that.Then she gets up to go outside and have it out with a rooster her first morning home.  Really?  that just seemed dumb.  I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on.  I met the hero and it seemed like the aunt did something to come between him and the heroine but the heroine has no idea what she did.  I think.  I finally gave up on this one and quit reading.  I did go back and read some reviews before writing mine and discovered a few were as confused as I was.  They did get further in the book than I did.  This really sounded like a mixed up group of people and the vodka soaked aunt needed to be tossed off a cliff.read for yourself and see what you think.

9799,"I am a sucker for small town stories as I grew up in one. This book has the authentic small town feeling with the predictable small town people. There are always those who stay, those who go away, those who &#34;make&#34; it and those who don't. That's the way it is. I guess what makes this different is that the character, Lee, is based on a real life friendship the author has with Bon Iver. I don't know the group so that made little difference to me.This little town is in Wisconsin and is told from the viewpoint of five people- the married couple, Henry and Beth who stayed; the rodeo star, Ronny, who is injured and returns home; Kip who makes a nice living in Chicago and comes home to rejuvenate his hometown and Lee, the major rock star who can't cut his roots. The idea that no matter where you are in life you are still most comfortable with the people you grew up with is an idea that I agree with. At age 61 when I am with my childhood friends it is as if no time has passed.  After all, they know all about you. They know your families and your secrets.This book would have been better if they had explored that relationship more. The best part of the book was when Lee spent the night at Ronny's before Henry and Beth's wedding. The interaction with Ronny's father was so perfect and so telling. There just wasn't enough of those moments.  I think it revolved too much around the hero worship of Lee.  Yes, it's wonderful that he's famous and comes home again. If Lee is based on Bon Iver then I suppose Henry is based on the author. That may be why Henry came out too perfect and one dimensional. He didn't ring true.The ending was absurd.  It really spoiled the book for me. The incident was unlikely and the bro-romance was over the top. While the writing was good, the ending dropped my rating to three stars. It could have been so much better.",3.0

9807,"Afterparty ended up being one of those books that I thought was one thing, but turned out to be something else, entirely.  The writing and dialogue in this book charmed me, and while I know it won&#8217;t be for everyone, I thought that Emma&#8217;s inner dialogue and sense of humor brought a lot to the story.  I liked Emma, and I could relate to her, so I guess I was drawn in by her obvious need to get out from her her father&#8217;s watchful eye and her strong inner conscience that with which she is always at war.  Her move to LA is ushered in with a kiss from a stranger at a beach club, which seemed strange at the time, but really set the tone for what Emma would experience in her new home.  The income level and lifestyle of the teens at Emma&#8217;s new school is not one that many of the readers will have first hand experience with, but I thought the book did a good job of showing how the wealth and privilege most certainly did not buy happiness for anyone. Another standout for me was the presence of a single parent that did not just disappear.  So often in YA it seems that the single parent dynamic is used an an excuse to eliminate all adult oversight, but Emma&#8217;s father, while perhaps a bit naive at times, did not fade into the background, and I appreciated that because I think it really gave me a good idea of Emma&#8217;s character and the inner conflict she was experiencing.Afterparty was dramatic, and there was a certain guilty pleasure aspect to the story, but this book was also about Emma struggle with who she is.  It wasn&#8217;t just the usual, I am a teen and must test boundaries stuff, although there was a bit of that, but it was also about Emma&#8217;s whole family history.  Her mother&#8217;s addiction, and her father&#8217;s unwillingness to discuss it, weighs heavily on Emma&#8217;s identity and her friendships and romances are all colored by the voice in the back of Emma&#8217;s head that constantly wonders if she will turn into the woman that has essentially haunted her small family unit all these years.  Her friend Siobhan, who will strike fear and sympathy into the heart of any parent reading this book, was a great catalyst for a lot of the drama.  On one hand, she was the defense against the mean girls at school, but on the other hand, she was as self-destructive as they come and some of her escapades truly made me cringe.  Dylan, who in many ways was the male equivalent of Siobhan, was an interesting romantic interest for both girls.In the end, Afterparty was a book that combined indulgent fun with a story that had a very strong moral compass.  Without being preachy in any way, it showed the snapshot of a journey that contained a lot of conflict, doubt, and ultimately a resolution that balanced entertaining with satisfying.  It was a book that artfully combined a thoughtful story with pure entertainment.",4.0
9808,"This was a gripping book that I couldn't put down (I downloaded the Kindle version during a free promotion and read most of it on my iPad). I found that it was appropriately timed for my life, as its subject is grieving the loss of a family member, and I was reading it after going through a tragedy. In this book a 12-year-old girl dies in a tragic accident. Her mother, father and brother are left to pick up the pieces of their lives and try to move on without her.I definitely had some &#34;issues&#34; with this book, but not enough to stop reading it. Some plot lines were overly contrived, cliche and unrealistic. It switched narrators/points of view from one character to another, which normally irks me to no end, and I can't say I loved it in this book but it actually worked out okay. And the characters were frustrating-- I get that they were supposed to be having trouble communicating but this tension/plot line dragged on and on and on until I was annoyed by it.I thought that the mother was ignoring her son and while I understood her grief about her daughter I didn't think she was being the best mother to her son. At the same time, I thought the dad/husband was being whiny and demanding too much attention from the mom/wife while she was trying to grieve. He seemed selfish and rather like a douchebag to me and I wished she wouldn't have felt so much guilt related to him and instead had felt more guilt related to her son. They were supposed to be this long-term romantic couple but I didn't buy it and it seemed like they barely knew each other. From reading the background on this author, she usually writes romance, so I would think that the husband/wife relationship would be written the best; however, ironically I felt it was the worst relationship in the book. I found it overly complex and then overly trite, but maybe I'm just not the right audience for the &#34;romance&#34; aspect of the book.With all of that being said, I still enjoyed the book and found it to be a good distraction from everyday life, which I needed when I read it. I ended up buying copies of the book for special women in my life for Mother's Day because I think almost any woman would like this book. It never got boring and kept moving on towards a relatively satisfying conclusion. I would like to read more by this author; however, this is her first mainstream fiction book and the rest of her books are romance, which I don't read. (There was a preview of one of her books at the end of this book that seemed interesting and non-romancy, though... even though it's classified as a romance... so maybe I'll check it out, because overall I did like the author's writing style.)",4.0

9819,"Living with GunsCraig R. Whitney spent his entire professional career as a reporter, foreign correspondent, and editor at the `New York Times'. This 284-page book is subtitled ""A Liberal's Case for the Second Amendment"". Whitney retired in 2009 as assistant managing editor in charge of standards and ethics, and lives in New York City. The phrase ""Second Amendment"" often results in an emotional reaction, this book is an attempt to provide a rational discussion (`Introduction'). Americans have an individual constitutional right to own and use guns. Most states say the same and allow carrying handguns in most places. This does not mean they can use them illegally (as the Trayvon Martin shooting). An individual can own and use firearms for self-defense, hunting, or any lawful purpose (p.xii).Should people have to demonstrate a need to carry a handgun? They don't have to do that to exercise the First Amendment (or the Fifth or Sixth, for example). Banning a complete class of guns is unconstitutional (the Heller decision). Should the rules against private gun sales be increased (p.xvi)? Whitney says `yes' but he is wrong. Banning the re-sale of privately owned guns reduces their value to scrap metal and allows their confiscation on the cheap (the Fifth Amendment). Registering firearms leads to confiscation (as in other places), and allows a regressive tax on the owners. The example of that theater shooting in Aurora Colorado is a poor one; I read that the shooter passed his or her background tests. Perhaps people should ask why there are ""mass shootings"" since they appear to have only occurred after WW II. That's about the time politicians began restricting gun ownership and use. That was also the time when Big Corporations destroyed a lot of small businesses (the corner grocery store, etc.). Is there any economic basis for ""mass shootings""? Is it the result of something in the food or water?The Gun Control Act of 1968 banned the import of firearms, such as any rifle that had a bayonet mount! Armies of the world were discarding their WW I era bolt action rifles to adopt modern arms (like the AK-47). These ""obsolete weapons"" were sold to anyone who would buy them. They said this law would make Americans safer. Then there were about 15,000 violent firearm deaths a year. Over the next 25 years this number escalated to 30,000 violent firearm deaths! You will have to find an old reference book, they may be censored from the Internet. This is a classic example of mis-diagnosing the problem and adopting the wrong solution. Murders are caused by love and money (lust and greed). Suicides are mostly caused by personal reasons. Sweden has the highest suicide rate in Europe. No guns? People jump off high buildings or overdose on medications.This book can't be easily summarized. A ""liberal gun law"" is one with the least restrictions, unlike the conservative or restrictive gun laws of England or Europe. Their laws were enacted because of a fear of a revolution by the people. The 1922 law in England may be a good example. The areas in Chicago with the most crime and murder are also the poorest. If you really want to reduce crime and not oppress people you should ask for an increase in the minimum wage ($10 an hour) and reduce taxes ($20,000 standard deduction for single, $40,000 standard deduction for married). A higher tax bracket of 70% on income over $555,000 would compensate. These numbers are proportionate to the dollar amounts in the prosperous 1950s and 1960s. It could also end the current depression.",3.0

9821,"Thanks to Netgalley for a free copy in exchange for review.I was super excited about this book because it was a chance to follow up with characters from a previous novel called Once Upon a Prince. If you haven&#8217;t read Once Upon a Prince, this book won&#8217;t be remotely worth it, so read that one first.What I really loved about this continuation of the story was the chance to learn about what the characters dealt with after the proposal. That&#8217;s usually where books end. I&#8217;m currently dealing with all of the logistics of planning a wedding and merging two lives, and it&#8217;s not a simple matter. Nate and Susannah had a unique situation, and I love that Rachel dealt with these matters seriously.I read some reviews that thought Susannah was stupid for hesitating on relinquishing her entire life to be with Nate, because &#8216;true love&#8221; will cause you to give up everything without a second thought. I thought that was ridiculous. Susannah had to give up far more than just her family and her roots to take on the duties of a royal of a new nation. I think any woman with any sense would have taken some time to consider the ramifications of what she had to take on.This novella was one of my favorites, and a great mini-sequel to Once Upon a Prince.

The first chapters address prediction biases suchas &#34;out of sample, out of mind&#34;, &#34;extrapolation&#34; and &#34;socialbias&#34;. That book is a nice complement to the cognitive biasesfound in Kahneman's book &#34;Thinking fast and slow.&#34; Bayes theoremis then introduced in the &#34;Less and less and less wrong&#34; chapter. Eachchapter describes a prediction failure from the financial crisis to9/11 via climate change. What I particularly liked is that hedescribes Bayes predictions as a cognitive attitude. We must bewilling to experiment, try different and several forecasts. In thissense, Bayes is very much like the free market enterprise incapitalistic societies, hence the title of this review.This capability to incrementally learn from the data with Bayes isvery important.

9829,"Very interesting account of life inside the White House through decades of different administrations from the perspective of someone dedicated to the job first, with a non-partisan work ethic. Mr. West describes these ladies as individually as they actually were, bringing them to life so that you see the human side of each lady, regardless of whether or not you agree with their politics. Mr West is careful not to sound gossipy or to sensationalize their lives while living in the White House. The book is tactful and tastefully written. This book is nothing like some other presidential/first family biographies I've read - no eye-popping, scandalous accounts of their daily lives, compared to other biographies. Thanks to Mr. West&#8217;s descriptions, I could almost visualize Eleanor Roosevelt running through the White House, from one meeting to another with tendrils of unkempt hair falling about her shoulders; or recall Jacqueline Kennedy's televised tour of the redecorated White House and hear her odd, whispery voice as she described each room.

(I was thinking, wondering how the reader might react to the comment I was about to leave about a book I struggled to finish so that I could leave an honest opinion about the entire book, and not just the first few chapters. But why would they be angry, knowing that I had read it from cover to cover, and was only expressing what was in my heart? Would they ever read a review I might write about another book? Why must I be so concerned about their reactions?) ... I think I've made my point, but if you didn't catch it, maybe you'll really enjoy this book.One more thing - I couldn't connect with any of the characters in the story. There may have been an abundance of thoughts and feelings flowing, but the only person I ""remotely"" felt for was the little girl, and only due to her unfortunate storyline (her first mommy and daddy). Still, sad to say, didn't feel a heck of a lot after that. Even the pool incident lasted a couple of pages and was quickly over and done with, and wrapped up nice and pretty on ""the wedding day"" when we find out that the 'tearful' neighbor realizes her negligence - excuse me, but if she acts like a bitch throughout the book, why bother to change her character in the last two pages of the book????

Along with her master tea blender, the debonair and classically elegant Drayton Connelly, and Haley, her indomitably creative and efficient chef extraordinaire, they create a little haven of heaven with their delicious offerings and their comforting atmosphere.Of course, Theodosia also stumbles into mystery. In this story, a dead body falls out of a wine barrel at Knighthall Winery&#8217;s wine-tasting party. As always, Theodosia is on hand and, since Drayton&#8217;s friend is the winery&#8217;s owner, she agrees to look into things.The best part of the story, however&#8212;and indeed, the entire series&#8212;is the little details: what the Indigo Tea Shop is serving for lunch, their oh-so-creatively themed tea parties, the colorful and sometimes wacky business owners in Charleston&#8212;including Delaine Dish, the slightly manic owner of a woman&#8217;s clothing store, Cotton Duck&#8212;and the descriptions of the beautiful city of Charleston. In this story, we also get a little education on the winery industry and, because the featured businesses are all small, there&#8217;s some interesting information about running a business in general as well.Theodosia Browning is a beautiful woman and she always seems to have a different boyfriend with each book, but there&#8217;s no serious love interest or love play here, only friendship.As always, Childs includes recipes for food to accompany tea, tea party theme ideas, as well as web sites, tea industry magazines, Charleston tourist information, and even lists of fine tea purveyors and tea plantations.A thoroughly enjoyable mystery and series and a sweet lovely ode to the city of Charleston.",5.0

9833,"It's hard to tell if I really liked this book. The book contained a multitude of characters. Of course, there were main characters but in every other chapter, a new person was introduced. It was difficult to keep up. Some things in the book just didn't make sense to me. For instance, how a criminal can get a way from the law when they know exactly were he is. I am talking about the revival in progress and every one see on stage and the police don't arrest him. Still, I want to see what the end is going to be for Pastor Hunter aka Jamal.

9836,"What C.J. Sansom does with Dominion - presenting an alternative history in which Winston Churchill does not become Prime Minister of Britain in 1940 and the men who do come to power agree to an appeasement with Germany that finds the now authoritarian government of Britain heavily influenced by their new Fascist friends - is simply fascinating! I love the idea of exploring how every little alteration and change of events can so heavily impact every aspect of our world. And the changes here make for some devastating and far reaching consequences.I have to admit that I got bogged down at times with the various political and social factions discussed and had a hard time keeping them straight (Socialism, Communism, Fascism, Nationalism, Imperialism....just so many &#34;ism's&#34;!). There is so much intricate history here as well - the various countries involved with this ongoing war for German domination, their various leaders and the shifting allegiances between countries, the scientific advancement during this time - that I found myself having to stop reading the book to go look up the many bits and pieces of factual history in order to be able to determine the changes taking places in this alternative world. This slowed down my reading somewhat and caused some confusion but the historical notes at the end of the novel did help alleviate some of that confusion.For me the driving force and what kept bringing be back into the story was the human element. Taking these broad and perplexing ideals and showing how they affected and influenced the people having to live under them made this shifted history seem real and frightening. It was sad yet inspiring to see the many reasons these characters joined Churchill's Resistance and was awe-inspiring to witness the bravery and selflessness they presented. On the flip side it was horrifying to see the greed, prejudice and cruelty of some of the other characters. All of these people came to life for me and thoroughly captured my attention.In particular the two characters that fascinated me the most were Frank Muncaster and Gunther Hoth. Both are such complex, well developed characters that kept surprising me with their growth throughout the story. Frank, the scientist holding a dangerous and deadly secret, is such a sad, scared, introverted character that spent his life being bullied and unloved by everyone but who proved to have more bravery than most could imagine when it mattered. Most surprising of all, I found myself remarkably feeling compassion for Gunther Hoth, a Nazi man through and through, who had lost so much throughout his life but carried on with a purpose and determination to do what he felt was his job and his duty to Germany. He is a monster for what he did and what he supported but one that had a heart, although a twisted and misjudging one in my opinion. I am always delighted to find a novel that makes me feel for characters that are so multidimensional.All in all Dominion is a thought provoking and complex look at how our world and its history can change on a dime based on the wills, egos, and actions of others and how the actions of the few can so alter the lives of the many. This is my first novel by C.J. Sansom but it will definitely not be my last.",4.0

9846,I found this book similar to his fantastic original books.  I really enjoyed his use of a &#34; futuristic&#34; yet very possible concept of using a app as a 24/7 doctor. The story has you hooked from the first page and you can't wait to see how it all ends. That is where I found the problem - it is as if Robin Cook just didn't know how to end a really good story. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the abrupt ending. I would definitely recommend it. It is a story that will keep you guessing throughout the book and keep you in suspense till the last page.I hope that this novel marks the return of the Robin Cook that writes those controversial medical stories that keep you on edge while reading the book and keeps you thinking about the topic for weeks after you have read the book.,4.0
9847,"When I first got a hold of this novel, I thought it was going to be one of those Holy Roller publications. Then when I got into the book, I thought that this novel was heading for the road to perdition. But it's really a mixture of these two predominant religious/ anti religious pathways. In my opinion, Anthony Rhine wrote a credible story balancing the inner happenings of a large Christian Church (not sure what denomination, most likely Protestant), and the mystery of afterlife. This book didn't seem like it would work, but it did in a far-reaching way. The novel held my interest for all of the 346 pages. I'm not sure I can compare this novel with another since the subject matter is so diverse. As a sidebar to the story, the reader is also educated on the differences between Scientology (all eight dynamics), Buddhism, Mormonism, and Hinduism from page 222 through page 241. So what is this story about? Okay, it's time for a synopsis.Our protagonist and narrator is Daniel Bolton. Dan has an unusual trait passed onto him by his mother. He can talk to the dead (mentally) right after they died, normally between four to ten days after passing. The dead are always in a dark transition room waiting to see the light. He has learned bits and pieces of information from them over the years. It seems that the light is called concatenus, which is a place where all spirits go to be linked together and share the intelligence with the whole (God?). Some of the dead get reincarnated instead of going back into the light. Dan is not sure about the people who are going to hell since he has never talked to one. On page 84, Dan states, ""You see, enough chats with spirits in transition have given me small glimpses into what awaits us beyond this earthly world, and I have been able to piece those glimpses together to get a sense of where we are going.""After High School, Dan gets a job with the Elizabeth Community Church as an actor in a play being performed at the church. The Pastor, Greg Woolfe, is a vile bigoted man married to Violet Black, a cold offensive assistant to the pastor (these are the road to perdition people). Somehow Dan prospers at the church and keeps moving up the ladder until he is on equal footing with Violet. Greg sends both of them to the seminary for gratis with the stipulation that they have to stay with the church until he retires. Greg and Violet have many poisonous foul mouthed arguments throughout the novel. Then Dan has a one-night stand with Violet (very bad move). Subsequently, Dan falls in love with a teenage actress, Melissa, acting in one of their plays at the church. He now has the obnoxious Violet Black as a enemy for life. The affair with Melissa is also going to cause grief for Dan in the future.What I liked about the novel was the way the author switched back and forth from the church activities to Dan's talks with the dead. Most notable was Dan's discussion with a dead man named Chen. Apparently, they were speaking Mandarin. They had a long talk while Chen was in the dark transition room. On page 246, Chen says, ""I can tell you this: I was right  to live a good life. I was right to believe that I would one day be where I am now and I was right that I  would eventually go back to where I am to go back to."" ""Concatenus?"" I (Dan) wanted to say it again, seeking further confirmation. ""Daniel, that is only a word"" (answers Chen). This is some good stuff. So what I am wondering is this: Does the author believe in the afterlife that he describes in this titillating story? Well, maybe he will post a comment on this review and  reveal his thoughts. Listen, I only gave you tidbits of what this novel is about, there is much more woe ahead for our hero Dan in the ensuing pages. I highly recommend this enlightening novel, so go out and buy your own copy.",4.0

At ten volumes, it is one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) science fiction work ever written. Brilliantly plotted, it is a delight to read.

9855,"Another excellent Oliver Sacks book built on case studies, with a review of the history of the phenomenon (even back to antiquity), salted with personal experiences and accounts of youthful indiscretions.  Many of the cases are weird or lurid, so the book is quite entertaining.  The presentation is sufficiently scholarly that the cases will be useful paradigms for others investigating epistomology or religiosity, though Sacks touches only lightly on these issues.  There is a good index and an excellent bibliography.The cases chosen are mostly not people who are &#34;crazy,&#34; and part of the point must be that the range of normal human ability and experience is much wider than most of us believed.  I hope this is consoling to practitioners in mental health; I note that some other readers were offended to read that not only saints have visions and, yes, doctors often abuse drugs.As far as science goes, there isn't much.  Sacks observes that poking specific parts of the brain can produce certain effects fairly consistently, and he offers some conjectures and hypotheses as to why, but the bottom line is that we really don't know.  This is how science begins, collecting and sorting observations, and poking things to see if something will happen.  I think Sacks' books provide a valuable service in disseminating expertly documented case studies which others can build upon to devise better experiments and theories.They are good reads.",5.0

The beginning took a bit to get off the ground, but I liked the characters and I liked the different take on the vampire world. In this novel only men can be vampires, but they feed their blood to women making them stronger thus training them to become their &#34;watchers&#34;. All of these young woman have been cast from general society for one reason or another so this stop on Isle of Night is literally their last stop. Many of them will die during the training that lasts several years before they are made a watcher.I'll admit there are lots of unrealistic moments, but isn't that always true with any paranormal read. The apparent ease with which the vampires are able to get all of these girls onto the island is a bit of a stretch as well as how quickly the girls accept their new roles and that vampires really do exist. You would think a hundred girls witnessing a vampire attack would all run off screaming, but no, they just follow said vampires to their dorms where they accept their new fate and proceed to attend classes and training to learn their new roles. Big picture though I enjoyed this set up for the series and plan to continue with the rest of the books.",4.0

The romance is only a side story -- the real story is about all the details relating to the refurbishment of the Inn, and the plans to buy stuff to put in it.  The heroine is perfectly acceptable but seems untouched by her past, the Hero is unbelievably perfect, and there is absolutely no tension in the relationship at all.

9892,"A caveat to this novel:  many moons ago, when I was a little kid reading by my nightlight under a blanket next to my bed, I would start every book by reading the final page first.  I'm a Happily Ever After kind of girl and I had to know if it was worth my time to read the previous pages.  If you are anything like that, DO NOT SKIP TO THE END.  Just trust me on this.  Now, I will highly recommend that you have Armed & Dangerous laying right beside you as you approach the last few pages of Divide & Conquer.  Just trust a sister on this.  It is the only thing that saved my Kindle from sailing through a window.  ;-)That being said, I really do love Divide & Conquer.  I love the reality of their lives that it show. It is, at its' essence, Ty & Zane living real life and realizing that the real life they have, while good, could be better.  It is them shouldering through the ups and downs of figuring things out amid the real pressures of real life in a real relationship.  It is them coming to terms with actually finding themselves wanting just what everyone else has, with all the crap that comes with it.  Of course, it is Ty & Zane, so it is set against the backdrop of destruction and chaos.  And that makes it perfect.",5.0

9895,"I liked this story about a feisty woman doctor in the 1880's, when it was practically unheard of for women to be doctors.  It was interesting to learn about some of the medical practices, including ones being discontinued such as using leeches to bleed someone.  I liked most of the characters but Elizabeth's roommate, Gwen, got on my nerves for a very poor choice she made and for her attitude.  I wished the story had a bit more action in the middle but it made up for it in the end!  This can easily be read as a stand-alone, but characters from previous books are present and mentioned.  I liked the sweet romance and the struggle the main characters had over what their futures should look like, from Elizabeth wanting to remain a doctor but wondering about marriage and motherhood to Jason's ideas of what a mother should be.

9896,"I will admit, at first I was put off by the disagreeable main character of Ms. Lederman's story, Edna. I wasn't sure how this book and I would get along. Would I arrive at a sour teenager who redeems herself or not allow myself to get there; frustrated and closing the book, unable to take her unpleasantries, along with her grouchy grandparents for another page?Edna made me roll my eyes and for a brief moment I wanted her to die out there in that desert. Ms. Lederman writes her so well. Edna was me as a teenager, the girl I want to go back and smack from here to next Sunday. Then, with the introduction of a gentle local boy, I became lost in the story. A little romance will do that to me, you know. Finally I wanted to see the change in Edna, I wanted to hear grandpa speak, and most of all, I wanted to keep my book open.Ms. Lederman's characters are deep and set among the beautiful backdrop of a simple desert life. Her writing is solid, with admirable character and plot growth. This is truly a wonderful coming-of-age tale that all teenagers should sink their teeth into. By the end of the book I was moved and satisfied with how Edna's summer was wrapped up.",4.0

9904,"SOW was a very different kind of MC book for me...much of it was about PTSD and what happens to some men when they return home from war. It was heartbreaking and emotionally troubling in many parts, since the three main characters had known each other since they were young, and there had always been a love triangle pulling at them.This book started off a bit slow for me, but once we got into the story (and especially after the men returned from war) and settled back into their lives in the club, it got really exciting and violent. Landon and Grace both made some really bad mistakes and especially Grace who was sent into a deathly downward spiral with her bad choices.There was an HEA of sorts anyway after much turmoil, and this book was such an emotionally draining experience, I was happy to see a light at the end of so much darkness and despair.This is not like any other MC book you have read before...more of a relationship study that just happens to be among some ex-military bikers and the woman they love.**** 4 **** &#34;love, honor and devotion&#34; stars",4.0

I've been buying a lot of recipe books in the last 6 months, and with few exceptions, this one has been the best by far.  The recipes are easy (bonus!!) and so tasty.  I've made 8 of the recipes so far (roasted asparagus with feta?  Swedish kale chips? Swedish spaghetti squash?  YES PLEASE!)  Even the Swedish Pickled Beets and the Swedish Cucumber Salad recipes tasted exactly like my saintly Swedish grandma used to make.  Now I know her secret, she must have had this recipe book!

9911,"'Drunk in Love' is the second book in the More Than Friends series so firstly I'd definitely recommend picking up the first book, especially since at the time of writing it's free on Kindle! The book carries on following the lives of two gay lovers Zach and Ryan and their decision to go on a romantic weekend that brings changes in their lives that they'd never anticipated. Unlike similar books in the genre that I've read, Drunk In Love manages to play with your emotions and still leave you desperate for more, a characteristic which I think is becoming a hallmark of the More Than Friends series. What I like most of all is how the author Aria Grace has expertly managed to balance the gripping underlying plot of the story with scenes of steamy erotica without making the plot confusing or erratic. Overall I think that if you're looking for an enjoyable piece of erotic fiction that's easy to dip in and out of, Drunk in Love certainly won't disappoint!",5.0

The book is about an MI5 assassin who decided that killing people for the government wasn't his thing anymore. He wanted out. So he went off-grid and found himself helping a poor lady deal with raising a teenager in a drug and gang infested neighborhood. The dialogue is great. The depiction of live in a ghetto is spot on. Things turn for the worst as you might expect, and the fact that MI5 leadership has chosen to eliminate loose ends doesn't help matters. I'll leave the rest up for you.

The main character, I think her name was Almose, was but a 12 year old when the story begins. But, she does gain a few years throughout the story. I read the whole book, I wanted to know what was going to happen, but when I finished the book, I felt 'incomplete'. Maybe that's not the right word, but anyway, I pondered the book and it's writing. The writer was a good writer, but for me, there was such a strange character development. Some of her characters I just did not understand. One minute you think you have their character figured out, and on the next page the character acts so 'out of character' you wonder, 'what the heck? That's not what that character would be doing!' So, you decide. An interesting setting, where by reading you learn, but the story itself is lacking. To me the ending was no ending. The story just stopped.",3.0

9929,"1. She writes strong, smart, independent women. She has women maybe falling of track and then picking up their own pieces. You may not think that Lexi was, but I do. She was independent and strong. Linde does not disappoint. Liz, is sarcastic, quick, intelligent, and holds her own- which is hard to do because Brady is a force. There are a lot of situations in this book that would have any female lead, whiny and bitchy, Liz is none of those. WITHOUT being a pushover. She speaks her mind. Love her. To be honest, every single character was strong and intriguing. I was automatically sucked in by them, captivated. I had put in the release party that it was not the forbidden romance, but to me the need to get more of these characters and the chemistry.2. Linde is intelligent. Not saying that other authors are not, but political wise. I love politics, I have read a few other authors. I find that A. They either no nothing about it and avoid any topics of government, B. No nothing and straight wikipedia it, C. No everything and decide it is best to put everything into one book. Not all of the readers are political. I think Linde did PoliSci? yes, no? But either way, she streamed in political topics that were enough to keep the political minds intrigued and not bore the non political minds.3. The ending was not a cliffhanger but a .... without giving too much, we were able to see another side to someone and understand some of their inner struggle, and we were able to see a powerful move. well played. I will be waiting for the next book, but I will not be anxiously waiting. The book, ultimately, could have ended at this one and I think that is a plus.Overall, I loved it. It was sexy, and smart. Kudos Linde.",5.0
9930,"Patenaude's book is primarily about Trotsky's years in Mexico, from January 1937 until his assassination in August of 1940 (his ""flashbacks"" to earlier events are not as well researched, and contain a number of errors). That's the only reason I read it, since Mexico is the weakest part of the definitive Isaac Deutscher trilogy,The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921,The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921-1929and theThe Prophet Outcast: Trotsky 1929-1940, being given only one chapter in the last of these, a book that covers Trotsky's life from 1929-40.The author's thesis is that Trotsky was in decline, creating unnecessary battles with his followers. No one ever said that Trotsky was easy to get along with, but anyone with an understanding of Marxism knows that clarification takes place amidst the clash of ideas. Patenaude makes a big deal about what wasn't important, like the disagreements in the Socialist Workers Party in Trotsky accepting to invitation to testify before the Dies Committee (which became the House Committee on Un-American Activities. There were always some in the party at that time who wanted to present themselves as more ""revolutionary"" than Trotsky. Had Trotsky testified, it would have given him an opportunity to speak more directly to the American working class, and he would not have said anything different than what he said anywhere else. But apparently Dies understood this, and probably only invited him thinking he would refuse. When he accepted, Dies rapidly cancelled the invitation, giving Trotsky the moral high ground.The split with the Shachtman group was a big deal, but Patenaude totally fails to understand what it was about. He blames Trotsky for precipitating  the split, which he views as totally unnecessary. He quotes a member of the Shachtman group as saying ""The war broke out and we did nothing."" While the debate covered many important questions fundamental to Marxism, it was, above all, a debate about what position to take in World War II, the majority defending the point of view that Trotsky had always held, that of defense of the Soviet Union against imperialism, despite the Stalinist degeneration.This struggle took almost half the membership, but it left the party in a stronger position to fight against the war, and the persecution of the party under the Smith Act (seeTeamster Bureaucracy,Socialism on Trial) andThe Socialist Workers Party in World War II: Writings and Speeches, 1940-43 (James P. Cannon writings & speeches)) precisely for representing an important antiwar current within the labor movement.To fully understand the split with the Shachtmanites, one must read and understandIn Defense of Marxism: The Social and Political Contradictions of the Soviet UnionandThe Struggle for a Proletarian Party.The best part of the book is the use of important material from the archives of Joseph Hansen, secretary to Trotsky in Mexico, and life-long leader of the Socialist Workers Party. I also suggest reading the Pathfinder edition ofMy Life: An Attempt at an Autobiography, which has an introduction by Hansen entitled ""With Trotsky in Coyoac&aacute;n.""",3.0

9934,"My CommentsSome of my blogging friends have been reading this book so I noticed it recently and fell head over heels in love with both the cover and title, I immediately put it on my TBR (to be read/gotta have) list!  Then I got the chance to review it and it felt like a Christmas present had dropped into my lap, grateful doesn&#8217;t begin to explain how that felt.Welcome to Gudrid&#8217;s world, a Viking woman with heart and skills beyond the women of her culture.  The book starts off describing a pagan sacrifice that breaks Gudrid&#8217;s heart, but also begins her journey of faith in Christ.  If the god Thor requires such sacrifices, then Gudrid wants no part in obeying him.Even though I sooooo enjoyed the story, the writing really gets your attention from the start, I didn&#8217;t connect with Gudrid at first.  There&#8217;s just this sadness that stays with her even though she has done well for herself.  There&#8217;s only one character who is surprised by how many times Gudrid has been married, no one else finds this alarming so even though I agreed with that one comment I figured this was a common occurrence for this time period.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve been married how many times?&#8221;  From his intense look, I know he&#8217;s not being disrespectful with his question.&#8221;My favorite character in this story is the unnamed female wolf.  It&#8217;s amazing how Gudrid finds her and rescues her.  Even though wolves are predators, this one was easy to love as it protected Gudrid, her animals, and even her people.One of my favorite parts of the story is when Gudrid adopts two boys who come from enemy lines.  I was in amazement over that and this enhances the storyline tremendously!My favorite thing about Gudrid is her faith.  She puts herself and her desires last to care for and lead her people and her son.  This book is FULL of people making sacrifices and risking their lives for their clan, but Gudrid&#8217;s heart and discernment takes that to a new level.  She understands so much from observing, it takes a lot for her to trust others but when you have her loyalty you have it for life, and she&#8217;s all about keeping the peace but when her son&#8217;s life is in danger she&#8217;s willing to kill to protect him.  In the midst of all she&#8217;s undertaking, she still follows Christ with all her heart and even tells her people about Him without preaching.  Her greatest desire is to be an example of God to her people when so many pagan gods are respected.I felt confused about who Leif was for the first part of the book, but that was my misunderstanding and not any fault with the writing.  I believed he had been one of her husbands that died and he&#8217;s Gudrid&#8217;s brother-in-law who is married to another woman.  Gudrid isn&#8217;t liked by most of the women from her home in Greenland, but she easily befriends her female slaves and does what she can to protect them from unwanted attention.There is much violence in the story, but it&#8217;s realistic to the time period.  Gudrid is willing to kill only when necessary.  Her people carry knives, spears, swords, and axes to protect themselves against enemy invaders.  Gudrid is unhappy and uncomfortable for most of the story until they leave the island.  The character I liked least was her sister-in-law, Freydis.  At first I was really intrigued by this character and her off color warrior, tree climbing ways, but Freydis does too many foolish things and is reckless for my taste.  She gets into enough trouble and creates enough conflict for the story to go forward, but she&#8217;s not someone I felt attached to or had respect for.  However, her craziness only illustrates Gudrid&#8217;s strength further as she fights to help her sister.  Freydis is a die hard loyal person to her family, but I also considered her a danger to herself and those around her.In an age when women had so few choices, survival was more important than comfort, and being a pagan believer was more common than faith in Christ, it&#8217;s absolutely amazing watching Gudrid cope with doing what&#8217;s right over what&#8217;s desired.  Marriage is more about business and survival than emotions, housekeeping skills with the women are vital among clans, and staying healthy in a constantly changing climate is crucial.  Gudrid doesn&#8217;t have vitamins to work with, but she knows her way around herbs and her faith has taught her that prayer and speaking words of life will help more than carrying a sword even though she does that too.  Being a Viking woman with faith in Christ is an unconventional way to live, but Gudrid makes it work despite the sadness she endures.I thought this book would be the Braveheart version for women (not so much), but there is plenty of action and I truly enjoyed seeing the Viking world through Gudrid&#8217;s eyes despite all the hardships she goes through.  There was one relationship I wanted to understand better and that was Gudrid&#8217;s marriage to Finn.  There are many misunderstandings between them, but everything does get resolved and I was overjoyed that they grow closer to one another.  Gilbert&#8217;s debut book is a definite treat and I&#8217;m so grateful for the chance to review it!  I couldn&#8217;t wait to see how the story progressed and went through this one FAST!  The book takes an honest look at life in the 10th century and brings the reader hope and action in authentic ways.  I&#8217;m grateful for characters like Gudrid (all she is able to overcome) and for writers like Gilbert who bring these stories to life.I want to thank the author for the review copy provided, truly thanks!!

9944,"This action-packed series ender explores authority, loyalty, sacrifice, and the fear of the unknown. It begins where &#8220;A Million Suns&#8221; left off, as a group of colonists are ready to leave their spaceship and land on planet Centauri-Earth after departing Earth five hundred years ago. It&#8217;s an original mixture of science fiction, mystery, and romance, set in a dystopian world.The first two novels introduced readers to Amy and Elder, who have formed a strong connection in adversity. The short chapters are told in their alternating first-person narration. The benefit is that this serves to move the action along at a quick pace. However, their voices are virtually indistinguishable, so while reading I had to be sure to make note of who was narrating each chapter.The trilogy is strong on the setup, suspense, revelations, and plot twists. The sci-fi scenario is skillfully brought to life, as the characters step onto an alien planet for the first time and the body count grows. The middle section moves a bit slowly, but the last one hundred pages of &#8220;Shades of Earth&#8221; are tense and fast-paced. I found the ending satisfying.",5.0

It teaches you many interesting facts about different animals (which is interesting enough on its own) and then it tells you how to apply their instincts and knowledge to your own life. I felt like I could relate more to some of the lessons than the others (my favorite lesson was the circus elephants) but I think that everyone could relate to, and learn from, at least one of nature's lessons.

9952,"This is marketed as a vampire book, and I do have to say that I felt that there was not as much about vampires as I expected. I would, in fact, categorize it as a ""Hell comes to earth"" book. Vampires are not the only baddie that shows up to plague our intrepid hero and his unit- they're not even the worst.Overall, I did actually enjoy this book quite a bit. This book reminded me (a bit) of the movie PRIEST.However, there were some serious flaws. The author uses just a select few adjectives to describe the same things over and over. If I had to read that something was ebon (black) one more time, I was going to scream. Also, things get described over and over, as though the author thinks his readers are too stupid to remember what he has already told them.Not all of the flashbacks are as clearly defined as they should be, although I never found them confusing enough to actually get lost.The sister's story is also not as developed as it should have been.In the end, I felt that this book deserved 3 1/2 stars. Since I can only give whole stars, I gave it 4 on the hope that this author can improve subsequent books.",4.0

9954,"Like most schools boys, I had heard of the Greek triumph over the Persians, focused mainly on Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans that died there saving the Greeks. And, oh yes, there was a naval battle. In the Battle of Salamis, Barry Strauss completes the story with an exciting story of them men and women and boats and weapons with which the Greeks and Persians went after them.What drew me into the book was the detail with which Strauss gives us in describing the ships and the men who sailed them. I found myself looking up pictures of a trireme so I could envision what these navies looked like.  Strauss details how the three decks of rowers were tied to their seats, how the marines stayed seated when they launched their spears or let loose their arrows. And he gives us brutal detail on how the boats rammed and speared each other in the narrow straits off Salamis.But ultimately it was the force of two men, Xerxes and Themistocles, who led their respective forces that determined the outcome of the historic battle between Greece and Persia. Strauss gives each his due, and fairly illustrates their strengths and weaknesses. A good sailor's tale well tols.",5.0

9957,"We know carbs are bad for us, especially white, refined carbs, but did you know that carbs can slowly destroy your brain? That&#8217;s the argument that David Perlmutter makes in his book //Grain Brain//.Perlmutter, a neurologist as well as board certified nutritionist, and founder of the American Board of Integrative and Holistic Medicine, is in a unique position to see how nutrition affects our neurology and his findings are astounding. He charges carbohydrates, especially glutens, with contributing to, if not downright causing, all types of prevalent and preventable diseases, such as dementia, ADHD, diabetes, libido, migraine headaches, depression, inflammation, obesity, and more. He proposes that humans have evolved to eat a high fat, low carb diet, but stresses that they must be the right kinds of fats, and in correct proportion. For instance, omega 3s and omega 6s should be in balance, in a 1:1 ratio. This diet, more similar to the Mediterranean diet than the low-carb Atkins diet, stresses meats, nuts, vegetables, and some fruits, as well as salad dressings and dipping sauces. It actually looks pretty tasty, even from a carb-lover&#8217;s point of view.With so many food books and opinions and diets out there, it&#8217;s difficult to know who to listen to. Perlmutter seems to have a valid opinion (no juice fasts or grapefruit diets here) and advocates veggies and meats, so you really can&#8217;t go wrong with that. But if you suffer from a chronic disease, have an interest in staving off brain disease, or even just want add more grist to the mill on the topic of food, diet, and nutrition, this might be a good read for you. If nothing else, it&#8217;ll help make you more aware of what you&#8217;re sticking in your mouth and we all can stand to be a little more aware of that.--Review also provided to portlandbookreview.com",5.0
9958,"This is a series of three childhood friends and their lives.  A story about a specific type of life.  Not normally the type of books I read, but they drew me in.  My mother-in-law even read them, and this is not the type of book she normally reads.  That said, we are not young adults. Following the lives of these three friends was very interesting.  You must read them in order, I will say I missed a couple of books in the beginning, I started a little late in the reading club my mother-in-law have, she filled me in.

9959,"There are six short stories in this novel.  Six different authors that bring lust and erotica to the pages.  I like to read something short and sweet and sexy after something intense or dark just to pull me out of my funk......the book hangover as it were.  These stories did that.  There is nothing heavy in the BDSM and it was fun. All six stories are individual, different and unconnected other than the mild BDSM.  All six are very well written.  Erotic, sexy and really hot as well.The Exhibition by: London Saint James: is about a woman and her best friend (gay male) attending his Brother's art show.  The trio has known each other for a very long time but, the older brother has skated around his attraction for her just as she has for him believing it would offend or upset the younger brother.  Then as with most misguided beliefs she tears away because she's afraid of being dumped....so she dumps him first...  That's when the fun begins.Amazing Maisie by: Raven McAllan:  A woman who would like to explore the BDSM world and is attracted to a DOM.  Fortunately her friend is his sister and they find themselves working toward a relationship that he coaxes her to even though she has nightmares about the possible things he expects (And doesn't actually want at all).  He is gentle and explains his intentions relieving her fears.  It is a loveable story.Liberating Lua by: Elyzabeth M. VaLey:  A Lord of the BDSM type is married to a genuine Lady and is afraid to invite her into his dark world.  So he uses a handmaiden to release his desires although, good husband that he is, never has sex with her.  The Lady has been taught from early childhood that a good Lady allows her husband the lust without her response.  But, she feels and is afraid to tell him.  Then she finds out about he handmaiden and demands to take her place....Wow.  This is definitely erotic in story and nature.Taboo by: Doris O'Connor:  &#34;Uncle&#34; Joshua has been infatuated to the point of distraction over the daughter of his best friend he has watched grow up.  She's twenty five now and his thoughts are no longer tame.  But, he's heavy into the BDSM life and she's pure and innocent......so he thought.  He discovers her being abused by a baby Dom and rescues her.  Come to find out our young Lucy isn't so innocent and has had the hots for Joshua for way too many years.  She's old enough to act on them now and she lets him know it in no uncertain terms.  It gets hotter, sexier and way more dangerous as her Father gets closer to finding out the truth about both of them.Lock Stock and Spank Her:  By R. Brennan:  I actually found this one to be the most &#34;fun&#34; of them all.  Beth is new to the world and her training Mistress is taking her to her first &#34;munch&#34;.  I had never heard that term before but, began to draw that it is a gathering and demonstration to introduce product and people....do not go on that as reality, strictly theory.  Beth is nervous.  Her Mistress finds out who her mystery &#34;friend&#34; is and she builds the nerve to talk to him.  He is the creator and demonstrator of the equipment being shown.  He asks her to volunteer and the feelings and emotions build for both of them.  This is a lighthearted and fun story.  I would love to see how a full version of this story would be told.The Cowboy and the Schoolmarm: by Nikki Prince:  This is a modern day western.  Fun, playful and one overbearing Dom of a cowboy (Would we really want for less?) Melanie is in love with Shiloh as young adults but, he goes off without ever telling her he'll return.  So she agrees to marry his friend.  He returns to late but, the husband dies and now she's a widow.  NOW, it's his turn to sway her back.  He goes after her full throttle.  She doesn't want to struggle but, she's torn with pride.  He has to push through it.  Hello, he's a cowboy Dom, is there any other questions?I enjoyed this Anthology very much.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes shorts or needs something light between the really heavy stuff that can leave you wrung out.  Definitely a pick me upper.  Very hot, a four fan set of stories.",5.0
9960,GREAT SERIES!!  Do not hesitate on this series if you love Marie Force.  The characters come to life and she reminds me of old school Nora Roberts.

9961,"Echo, Echo, Echo.... You beautiful, cocky, sweet, loving man. Torin has owned my heart, but Echo has shown that he is just as special in my eyes.Cora has just been released from a mental institution and wants nothing more than for her life to go back to normal. But how can you have normal when you are regularly followed by souls and your world has been inhabited by Grimnirs, Immortals, Gods, Norns and Valkyries, and there appears to be mystery and danger at every turn. And then there's the gorgeous, infuriating soul reaper who makes your blood boil one minute and has your heart doing flips the next.I like my books to be heavy on the romance and Ednah Walter's has delivered just what I need once again. I thought Cora's heart belonged to Eirik and I was so torn when Echo emerged on the scene. But Echo won me over. He is a man who truly believes that he's not worthy of love. He believes that his heart and soul are bad. Yes, he's done bad things but he's had such horrid pain in his life. Thank God Cora saw right through him and saw the beautiful, loving man that was buried under his cockiness. He protects, he cares, and he loves. Boy, does he love!!There was lots of mystery and action to offset the hot romance and I found myself questioning almost everyone's motives at some point during the book. I really felt that I was taking this great journey of discovery right alongside Cora as she learnt more about her new world and it's inhabitants and her abilities.I'm so happy that the author is writing these books to give us greater insights into the other characters. After reading this I liked Cora so much more. She has much more substance than what I originally thought. And as much as I want to get to know all the characters better, my greedy self is also jumping up and down because it means that the Runes series still has a fair way to go before it wraps up.Theres not one particular thing that makes Ednah Walters Runes series a standout to me. It's a whole combination of things. It's the fantastic, easy to read writing style. It's the world building and plot twists. It's the incredibly likeable characters. Its the gorgeous swoony males. It's the fine line between Young Adult and New Adult that she manages to walk the story along. This series just keeps getting better with each book.5/5 Cocky and Passionate Echo StarsThis book was gifted to me for an honest review.FAVOURITE QUOTES: I shook my head. I'd never met a man with a one-track mind. &#34;Just when I'm beginning to see something redeemable in you, you open your mouth and spoil it.&#34;***I wanted someone to kiss me like he couldn't get enough of me. Touch me like he'd die if we didn't. Look at me like he was seeing me for the first time every time we were together.

9964,"The short version of why Hellboy&#8217;s in hell is that at the end of the last Hellboy book, The Storm and The Fury, he slew the dragon and saved England but died when he was caught off guard and the ghost of the witch Nimue plucked out his heart. This is what happened next&#8230;Hellboy in Hell isn&#8217;t just the title of the book but a pretty accurate summary of what happens in the book. There isn&#8217;t a plot, it&#8217;s just Hellboy wandering around hell looking at stuff with a variety of different Virgils explaining what he&#8217;s looking at. This is weirdly the book&#8217;s strength and weakness because this is the first Hellboy book Mike Mignola&#8217;s both written and drawn in years, and his art has only improved with age. So while Hellboy meanders, the creatures and backgrounds he comes across are visually incredible.Here hell isn&#8217;t the fire and brimstone Christian stereotype but in Mignola&#8217;s hands becomes an ethereal, perpetually twilit land of eerie shadows against Victorian buildings. The effect is quietly chilling as wonderfully ancient structures give an old world atmosphere and provides a gorgeous backdrop to the flying demons and Lovecraftian monsters that float around. Pandemonium sits in the midst of the muted yet ominous Lake of Fire, a looming collection of ancient Roman-esque architectural buildings surrounded by creepy talking statues housing the seat of hell&#8217;s power, the Citadel of the Fly, and the Devil himself. If nothing else, Hellboy in Hell is worth picking up for Mignola&#8217;s first-rate art.But when it comes to story, things get a bit messy. Ideas like Hellboy going to the place where he&#8217;s been banishing monsters for decades, like a cop sent to prison and meeting all the criminals he&#8217;s put away, is touched on for a spell before being shuffled away and forgotten. Literary allusions pepper the script from Dickens&#8217; A Christmas Carol being parodied, to lines from Shakespeare and Milton being quoted, all of which give the impression of a deep, complex read when it really isn&#8217;t. Hellboy doesn&#8217;t want the throne of hell so Mignola throws in a line or two from Macbeth which says something similar &#8211; kinda obvious.The more successful elements of the narrative are things that have been explored in previous Hellboy books &#8211; Hellboy&#8217;s purpose for existing and his right hand of doom, which mark him out to be the heir to the throne of hell. Mignola re-treads some of this material but adds more detail behind Hellboy&#8217;s birth mother and introduces his demonic half-brothers who want Hellboy&#8217;s power even if he doesn&#8217;t. What happens when Hellboy encounters Satan himself is the most interesting part of the book as it makes the reader wonder what happens to hell afterwards but Mignola doesn&#8217;t take that thread any further (maybe to explore in later issues?).I appreciate Mignola&#8217;s ambitious vision where he&#8217;s literally creating his own idea of hell utilising numerous artistic sources throughout human history while making it distinctly his, and Hellboy&#8217;s, own, but I kept waiting for Hellboy to try to figure out a way to come back to Earth. He seemed more than happy to simply be just in hell &#8211; is this it? Is Hellboy going to be in hell, walking about while remaining nonplussed, forever? The final story in the book is a standalone piece where Hellboy&#8217;s having a smoke when a lost spirit asks him for help and they go on a little adventure. It seems indicative of Mignola&#8217;s approach to Hellboy&#8217;s new situation &#8211; that he&#8217;s content to keep Hellboy in hell for the time being and be in no particular hurry to return him to Earth, or point him in any narrative direction at all.The Descent isn&#8217;t the best Hellboy book if you&#8217;re looking for a more driven narrative but it&#8217;s fine for what it does which is establish and explore the fascinating new setting for Hellboy &#8211; though I&#8217;m assuming this is done because Hellboy&#8217;s staying in hell for a while; if not, then this is a lot of pretty filler. I would like to feel that there was a point to all of this but the ambling way Mignola writes these days shows that urgency isn&#8217;t something he&#8217;s overly concerned with and that he prefers to show interesting things rather than tell interesting stories &#8211; a quality that doesn&#8217;t make for amazing comics.The art really is gorgeous though and it isn&#8217;t hard to see why the book looks amazing when the art team is Mignola, Dave Stewart on colours and Clem Robins lettering, and parts of the book are entertaining to read but the overall impression of Hellboy in Hell Vol 1 is of a fragmentary and unsatisfactory story. Which is a shame because after Batman and Superman, Hellboy&#8217;s my favourite superhero and I really wanted Hellboy in Hell to be the masterpiece I hoped it would be but it turned out to be an underwhelming next chapter in the Hellboy saga.",3.0

It's extraordinarily smart and well-written and is filled with complex, flesh and blood characters I'll consider for a long time.One of the novel's most impressive achievements is the Tartt weaves the symbolism, compositional elements, and even biographical context of Fabritius's Goldfinch into the plot of this modern bildungsroman.All of that said, there are portions of this book which ALMOST jump the shark. It's probably about 100 pages longer than it needs to be, and the ending, though comprised of some of the book's most poetic writing, feels exhaustively verbose and incredibly awkward in its metafictional posture. These moments aren't enough to knock even one star off the constellation of this novel, but it is worth noting that Tartt has room to improve, which is scary.This is a no-brainer purchase. If you care about modern American fiction, art, and the ways we find to deal with suffering, this book is perfect.",5.0

9974,"The Guardian DukeBy: Jamie Carie5 starsReviewed by:AngelsFormat:Kindle/HardcoverPublished: B&amp;H BooksSource: Purchased Copy Gene:Christian RomanceBook Blurb/Synopsis-The Guardian Duke is award-winning novelist Jamie Carie&#8217;s most exciting story yet, a uniquely arranged Regency-era romantic adventure where hero and heroine know each other through written letters but have yet to meet.Gabriel, the Duke of St. Easton, is ordered by the King to take guardianship over Lady Alexandria Featherstone whose parents are presumed dead after failing to return from a high profile treasure hunt. But Alexandria ignores this royal reassignment, believing her parents are still alive and duly following clues that may lead to their whereabouts. Gabriel, pressured by what are actually the King&#8217;s ulterior motives, pursues her across windswept England and the rolling green hills of Ireland but is always one step behind.When they do meet, the search for earthly treasure will pale in comparison to what God has planned for both of them.Our ReviewWhat a great start to a series. I found the characters to be engaging funny , serious and some to be our white Knight !Alexandria becomes the guardian of the Duke of St. Easton when Alexandria's parents are presumed dead.Her parents are treasure hunting looking for a lost tomb that has gone missing from a collection. Alexandria does not believe her parents are dead so puts forth a plan to rescue them but, to do that she needs money to travel with. Alex corresponds with the Duke making up or stretching the truth about the amount of money she needs to keep things running at home. Alex letters are so funny they have you cracking up. She is talking to the Duke not knowing what to say to him, saying things no lady would say, speaking her mind in those letters a crossing certain parts out but ,sending the letter as is.Hilarious !The purpose of the letters is really to distract the Duke from making her leave her home a coming to him but, in doing so she is building a relationship with her Duke. Alex sets forth on looking for her parents and finds a champion to help her in her travels. The Duke learning she has gone from her home sets out to travel after her and bring her back to safely.These two play at Cat and mouse game the whole story through.Alex lets the Duke know her where abouts just enough to keep him interested but, always several steps ahead and out of reach as she is not going back to England she is finding her parents even if it kills her !I loved this story it was a very fun read and quite the page turner. I never laughed so hard reading the parts where Alex is writing her letters to the Duke.The Duke feels he has gotten to know who Alex is through her letters and learns that she is one of a kind.He is falling in love.This little adventure was packed with enough intrigue to keep you on the edge always wondering what will happen next. There adventure led them to developing a  long and lasting relationship.Alex might be developing a love interest which will complicate things for the Duke.The story right up to the end was delightful leaving a cliff hanger on what happens next ! This book is a keeper for me just one of the heart felt romances that is developing little by little without either party realizing the extent of there feeling just yet!Recommended read to all !",5.0

This was recommended by a friend who promised this was unlike anything else I'd ever read and to step out of my boring comfort zone.It definitely was not and I will stick to my comfort zone next recommendation.I do not like writing negative reviews. It is very, very rare for me to not finish a book and this was coming close to being the first book in four years that I did not finish.I think what kind of bothered me is that it seems like a ripoff of one of my favorite TV shows. I wondered more than once if the author is a fan of the show and if so, if she was inspired by it and this is her way of honoring said show.I disliked all of the characters. Every single one of them. Well, okay. Layla had some redeeming qualities and was the only one that I didn't want to run over with my fictional truck. Repeatedly.Not only is this a very slow read to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out, but could have used another go around with an editor as I found many misspelled words, incorrect grammar, and plenty of punctuation errors.Definitely a read for an adult who doesn't mind gratuitous language and graphic sex scenes {Note: I am over 21 and did read the warning and went by my friend's standard that it wasn't &#34;that bad&#34;.

I didn't really empathize with either character. I understood that she had a rough life (although this wasn't really developed until late in the book), and he's a &#34;control&#34; freak - but I didn't FEEL this by reading the story.Which made it unbelievably difficult to believe the D/s angle...He never explained what he expects from a &#34;subbie&#34;, and she just blankly followed his lead. I think I was expecting a bit more substance from this part of the book, in particular.Overall, it was a quick story full of romance (general & erotic).",2.0

9984,"Having this book toted as a YA series on Amazon and shelved in the Teen section at book stores is very deceiving.  My daughter and I both enjoyed the first book and we both looked forward to reading this second book, Endless Knights, as well. I borrowed this book from my daughter before she had a chance to read it and I'm glad I did.  Not because it is a great story, but because of the sex within.Maybe my opinions do not sit with the majority but I don't believe my teen needs to be fed such descriptions of a sexual act that was depicted in this book.  Instead of quoting the author's story and chancing a child reading this review, I would suggest you go to a book store and read page 115 before purchasing for your child if this type of thing is uncomfortable for them.  I stopped reading after page 157, as it just began to seem like a good story idea that was lost due to the unnecessary graphic nature.  In reading some reviews before I wrote this, I find that there are additional sex scenes with the main character and a different man.  I strongly feel that if publishers want to push books into the YA category, there should be a similar rating on them as movies and video games.  Why can't the publisher give the young adult consumer the heads up about explicit sexual content?  I don't feel that a young reader should be left to innocently stumble upon something so uncomfortable for them.",1.0
9985,"Cat has been pressing her husband of ten years for a foursome with their new next door neighbors.What started out as some smoking hot sex between four consenting adults went completely wrong. From the start you could see this was a train wreck just waiting to happen. In getting to know the characters a bit better, I took a dislike to Cat. She seemed like she was always up to no good. She came across as very fake. Her husband Drew seemed to just put it with her and whatever diabolical plan she was cooking up.Logan and his wife Alexis didn't have a great relationship either. Logan was always pointing out her faults and finding her lacking in just about everything. Alexis was the most reserved of all four of them. At times it looked as though she was participating in this kink only to please her husband.When all four of them get together in any kind of interaction it's apparent that Drew and Alexis would be the better match of the couples.Even knowing this was something horrible that would blow up in their faces, I couldn't put it down. With knowing it was bound to end badly, I still had to see it for myself.",4.0
9986,I found this a delightful story.  A modern version of the old classic.  Only a whole &#34;region&#34; moved back in time and across the ocean.  A good tribute to American fortitude and ingenuity.,5.0
9987,I received this book from the author for an honest review.So this book is alll Morgans POV from Boy in a Band to now.  She skims over her times with Matt and then begins to think about 'poor me&#34;.  She is also very very very self absorbed this novel.  I found myself not really liking Morgan.  I kinda wanted to smack her upside the head at times but then I remember that we all go through this kind of self envolvement when he are in pain.  Pain and hurt are Morgans feelins through this novel.  She is discovering life and granted she is doing it the wrong way buuuut who hasnt makde stupid choices right? *raises hand*I did enjoy seeing Morgan and her mother working on their relationship.  The two have a unhealthy reltionship which can also cause issues for a young woman.  Morgan needs support and her mother and her seem to be oil and water.  The unhealthy realtionship along with the stringing along of Matt caused her to hane ALOT of self esteem issues....she is always putting herself down which causes her to make sooo many bad choices........Ryan...sigh...loved him and the moments with Morgan and him.  I thought he was a great character to also be causing issue for Morgan.  BUt then he ends up stringing Morgan along too...ugh...poor girl......I was sooo stressed out and wanted to throw my kindle alot of the times.,4.0

9989,"I honestly wasn&#8217;t sure what I was getting into when I started reading about Cora Carmack&#8217;s new book All Lined Up and I could see the book already had a huge fan base even before the book was released. That made me nervous. Popular books and I tend to not mix for some reason. I should not have fretted because All Lined Up was amazing and nothing like I expected.Dallas is so over football. Her dad has coached multiple college and high school football teams, taking them from the bottom to the top and then they move on to another school. Dallas&#8217; first boyfriend played football and when they broke up she was done, or so she thought. The first night at school she meets Carson who is all kinds of hot and leaves her wanting.Carson is having a hard time fitting in at Rusk. He&#8217;s a transfer so none of the guys respect him and he needs to be better if he wants to stay at the school without making his parents give up more than they already have. He needs a scholarship and he won&#8217;t get that from his grades. He knows there can be no distractions but running into Dallas turns everything upside down.I am honestly in love with this series now. Cora Carmack does not disappoint with her new series.Dallas and Carson were great characters to read about. Carson is sweet and dedicated. Even when he knows he&#8217;s not supposed to be with Dallas he finds a way to be with her in any way he can. I honestly loved their relationship. They study and do homework together, they watch movies and do normal couple things together which was adorable and made their relationship all the more believable.Both characters really grow from amazing characters to awesome characters. Where Dallas is scared to love and be vulnerable she learns to be herself and comes out of her shell, with the help of Carson of coarse. Carson thinks he&#8217;ll never be good enough but over time he learns to have more confidence within himself, which I mean who doesn&#8217;t love a hot confident funny guy? I know I do!I honestly loved this book. Everything about this story made everything so realistic and enjoyable. I loved the humor and constantly found myself laughing while reading. My heart would ache when things got hard and I could hardly put this amazing story down for a second. All Lined Up is an amazing addition to the rising New Adult genre and I can&#8217;t wait for the next installment.",5.0

9992,"Intense and not for the faint of heart, Craig Wallwork&#8217;s Gory Hole explores not only the darkest recesses of humanity, but every disturbing orifice. Mixing dark humor and a grisly canvas of human behavior, at times I felt horribly vulnerable, others, offended (as in all the best of horror), and still others, addicted to the page. Only a writer of Wallwork&#8217;s talent can create such a viscerally encompassing experience that left me with literal nightmares. His work is diverse, from his mythical collection, Quintessence of Dust, to the strange macabre noir of To Die Upon a Kiss, to this bizarro trio of horrific tales, so that every work is an evocative foray into the depths of human nature. His prose is organic and vibrant, painting emotions through body parts:&#8220;After a short drive up the path they were met at the door by an old man. Framing his head and jaw was hair the colour of piss-drenched snow. Deep ravines ran through his forehead like electrical signals from an erratic heartbeat. Hands were hidden by industrial rubber gloves and a large apron draped over his church bell figure.&#8221;Gory Hole isn&#8217;t just a trip down a rabbit&#8217;s hole, but a gory plunge. Just make sure you don&#8217;t lose your head to the zombies of Wallwork's imagination.",5.0
9993,I've tried to start this graphic novel a couple of times but it's so drab compared to &#34;Flashpoint: Batman - Knight of Vengeance Special Edition #1&#34; that I loose interest en route. Please give &#34;Flashpoint&#34; a look instead as it was much better and even free last I looked.,2.0
9994,"Not so Much this.  There is a less genuine respect for the more organized forms of spirituality and Iam put off by a more monied lawyer able to spend a fortune to hunt down her spiritual teachers.  I am also a little put off by the world wide web of spirituality.  Maybe its my age or temperament, but this volume which I sought out after reading her most recent book did not inspire or satisfy.I would not recommend this to a friend",2.0

9996,"I didn't thing that much of this book.  I am a boater and a lot of what was going on in the boat didn't seem to me that real or believable. The characters, at least to me, were boring. They ended up being way to intertwined by the time the story ended to be real live people! I did finish the story, didn't take long to read (maybe a day) --- and, didn't fall asleep so maybe a skin-diver would enjoy it more then I did!  I really enjoyed how the two bottle-nosed dolphins brought the missing person back to the boat and how they intermingled with the people.",3.0
9997,"It is an emotional TRIP to the past with Trip and Layla. I love the ease in the writing style and all the references to the 90&#8217;s. I was a connoisseur of Love&#8217;s Baby Soft. I blame it on an underdeveloped brain and impressionable advertising. My all time favorite passages involve the phrase ~ Are you there, God? It&#8217;s me, LaylaThere are some truly fantastic lines in this book.  Very fitting the high school years. ~Trip was like a one-man beautification committee just by existing. ~ Had he picked up on my tomboy vibe even though I was sure I hadn&#8217;t been putting it out there? Dear God. Was it Brian Hollander all over again? ~ To her I was Saint Layla, after all. It&#8217;s not as though she had any reason to suspect that I was actually planning on f$%&ing; her son&#8217;s brains out that night.As much as the funny moments are hilarious and the time flew by what really stuck with me as I read were those tender and at times uncertain and awkward moments of first love and finding your place in the world and among your peers. &#8220;Maybe Someday Just not today.&#8221; ~ I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll understand one day when you find that one person you know you&#8217;re supposed to be with, you&#8217;ll do whatever you have to do in order to be with him. ~The letter and picture killed me. What can I say I&#8217;m a sap and Trip has some really good moves. The lessons on popularity and fitting in, the future, small towns and dealing with family were all spot on. A very strong opening with interesting characters to set up the series. I can&#8217;t wait to see what the uncertain future holds.",5.0
